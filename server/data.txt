A design system is a set of standards, reusable components and patterns used to create visual
</text>
<text start="5.89" dur="6.419">
consistency throughout pages and projects. Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping
</text>
<text start="12.309" dur="5.89">
tool in this course, Tim Sullivan will teach you how to create a design system using Figma.
</text>
<text start="18.199" dur="3.5">
What is going on you guys Tutorial Tim here. And today, I&#39;m gonna give you a brief overview
</text>
<text start="21.699" dur="5.29">
of what we&#39;re going to be covering in this series to come, I&#39;m going to be creating a
</text>
<text start="26.989" dur="3.09">
design system. And this design system is going to be materials
</text>
<text start="30.079" dur="5.03">
design system in figma. And I&#39;m going to do my best to translate what
</text>
<text start="35.109" dur="5.981">
is currently being displayed on this website into figma itself as a design system.
</text>
<text start="41.09" dur="7.23">
So we&#39;ll be going over First, the foundation. And the foundation entails things such as
</text>
<text start="48.32" dur="5.19">
the layout, and what is layout, like a response to creating these responsive grid layouts
</text>
<text start="53.51" dur="3.349">
of styles and figma. Understanding how to build these out using
</text>
<text start="56.859" dur="3.921">
proper space spacing methods, and how components will be laid out on them.
</text>
<text start="60.78" dur="5.08">
So we&#39;ll be going over that. And we&#39;ll also be going over how to apply
</text>
<text start="65.86" dur="4.76">
a color system utilizing material designs color system and implementing that into figma,
</text>
<text start="70.62" dur="6.79">
as well as style color styles. And also, we&#39;re going to be going over typography
</text>
<text start="77.41" dur="5.61">
and building out the typography system that is specified here in material design.
</text>
<text start="83.02" dur="3.74">
But in figma, how do we do that and translate this into figma.
</text>
<text start="86.76" dur="7.42">
Also, we&#39;ll be going over iconography. And with iconography in figma, we&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="94.18" dur="6.9">
to be basically applying the structure for the letter specified in the product icons.
</text>
<text start="101.08" dur="4.69">
I&#39;ll have this set of icons already in figma when we go over, but I&#39;m gonna show you how
</text>
<text start="105.77" dur="3.34">
to organize it and access it via the instance drop down menu.
</text>
<text start="109.11" dur="5.07">
So you can swap amongst common components and other component icons, which are components
</text>
<text start="114.18" dur="4.84">
as well. And also, we&#39;re going to be going over a portion
</text>
<text start="119.02" dur="4.53">
of interaction, which is states states being states for certain components.
</text>
<text start="123.55" dur="5.7">
So in that portion of building design system, we&#39;ll go over foundation.
</text>
<text start="129.25" dur="3.4">
And then moving on from that, we&#39;ll go to components.
</text>
<text start="132.65" dur="5.52">
And we&#39;ll literally build every single component on this page from scratch and utilizing the
</text>
<text start="138.17" dur="7.86">
foundation that we&#39;ve created in figma. So we&#39;ll start with the app bars, app bar
</text>
<text start="146.03" dur="7.06">
bars, bottom at bars top all the way down to the very last component being tooltips.
</text>
<text start="153.09" dur="4.84">
And we&#39;ll go over how to, like construct it via its anatomy, right.
</text>
<text start="157.93" dur="4.86">
So we have all this information, how to use it the placement and behavior.
</text>
<text start="162.79" dur="5.84">
And basically, I&#39;ll teach you how to basically view this file and build it out in figma,
</text>
<text start="168.63" dur="4.27">
from scratch and apply the proper constraints. So it&#39;s responsive, just in case designers
</text>
<text start="172.9" dur="5.73">
need to modify it. And that is basically going to be the design
</text>
<text start="178.63" dur="3.18">
system that we&#39;ll be building in figma, which is material design.
</text>
<text start="181.81" dur="9.09">
And that&#39;s the brief overview. I&#39;m gonna start off with a color system is
</text>
<text start="190.9" dur="4.43">
Yeah, so it&#39;s gonna kind of start off with referencing the website to give you guys an
</text>
<text start="195.33" dur="3.58">
understanding what we&#39;re going to be building out in in figma.
</text>
<text start="198.91" dur="4.91">
And what we&#39;re going to be doing in figma, is basically translating, I&#39;m going to give
</text>
<text start="203.82" dur="2.55">
you a brief overview right now what we&#39;re going to be doing throughout the whole course
</text>
<text start="206.37" dur="3.14">
of the video, to give you a general understanding. So we&#39;re gonna start with the color system,
</text>
<text start="209.51" dur="4.65">
implementing colors, and then adding that into figma as a library, so you can see them
</text>
<text start="214.16" dur="3.56">here. For those of you who have, for those of you</text>
<text start="217.72" dur="4.92">
who are able to utilize libraries, you can see this color palette here.
</text>
<text start="222.64" dur="3.02">
And all the styles that have been created in that library.
</text>
<text start="225.66" dur="7.81">
So with my material design, system colors file and rename that real quick material design.
</text>
<text start="233.47" dur="5.28">
And we got materials on here. And now, if I go here, we&#39;re going to be able
</text>
<text start="238.75" dur="4.81">
to add it to this library that will publish eventually, with all these colors, but this
</text>
<text start="243.56" dur="2.67">
current files already published. But what I&#39;m going to do is delete all these
</text>
<text start="246.23" dur="5.34">
real quick. All right, so we have these colors, we have
</text>
<text start="251.57" dur="3.21">
color styles, but we haven&#39;t added into the library, I&#39;m gonna show you how to do that.
</text>
<text start="254.78" dur="5.209">
But I&#39;m gonna show you how to do that by developing the developing book creating this color system,
</text>
<text start="259.989" dur="4.9">
we&#39;re gonna use the baseline material color theme, to showcase how to build out these
</text>
<text start="264.889" dur="3.92">
colors as styles and figma for your whole team to utilize in figma.
</text>
<text start="268.809" dur="3.551">
If you&#39;re working for an organization, for example, or just a team, it&#39;s a much more
</text>
<text start="272.36" dur="5.19">
effective way of working. So basically, what I&#39;m going to do is screenshot
</text>
<text start="277.55" dur="3.209">
this to have all these values, so I don&#39;t want to go back and forth between browsers.
</text>
<text start="280.759" dur="6.921">
And once I have that done, I&#39;m just going to remove everything here.
</text>
<text start="287.68" dur="3.65">Don&#39;t need that. Don&#39;t need that.</text>
<text start="291.33" dur="3.369">
And I&#39;m going to start this is like a brand spanking new file so you guys can follow.
</text>
<text start="294.699" dur="3.09">
Follow me from scratch. I already have one page and I&#39;m actually gonna
</text>
<text start="297.789" dur="10.44">
label this primitives because This, this component is a primitive component.
</text>
<text start="308.229" dur="5.321">
So the way we&#39;re going to structure all these components, in terms of its complexity is
</text>
<text start="313.55" dur="6.39">
from like its very simplest form, that being labeled as a primitive, all the way to components,
</text>
<text start="319.94" dur="3.409">
and then patterns, which are composed of several components.
</text>
<text start="323.349" dur="4.72">
And we&#39;ll get more into that later. But let&#39;s just get started with the colors.
</text>
<text start="328.069" dur="5.81">
So now I have the screenshot pasted here. And what I&#39;m going to do is basically translate
</text>
<text start="333.879" dur="4.581">
all these colors into styles. So without any further ado, I&#39;m just going
</text>
<text start="338.46" dur="4.15">
to create some rectangles. And actually, I&#39;m going to hit Ctrl, C, to
</text>
<text start="342.61" dur="5.29">
copy this value here. Notice that when I use Ctrl, C, the hex value
</text>
<text start="347.9" dur="8.009">
isn&#39;t what&#39;s indicated in the screenshot that I&#39;ve selected to copy the value and apply
</text>
<text start="355.909" dur="3.771">
to the rectangle. So I&#39;ll have to manually input and put that
</text>
<text start="359.68" dur="8.879">
value that&#39;s indicated there. And I&#39;m just going to keep doing this until
</text>
<text start="368.559" dur="8.121">
I have completed all of the color values. And I&#39;ll see you when that is done.
</text>
<text start="376.68" dur="7.859">
Right, so I&#39;ve now completed creating all these color blocks for you in figma, just
</text>
<text start="384.539" dur="3.391">
to kind of visually show you and apply the correct color rows, because actually, what
</text>
<text start="387.93" dur="3.419">
I wanted to originally do was use a control picker and apply these values, but it doesn&#39;t
</text>
<text start="391.349" dur="6.201">
actually reproduce the exact hex values specified in the image, because of the screenshot that
</text>
<text start="397.55" dur="4.369">
I grabbed. And anyways, long story short, let&#39;s make
</text>
<text start="401.919" dur="3.75">
these color styles now. So now we&#39;re going to add the this into our
</text>
<text start="405.669" dur="1.75">
color system. Currently, we don&#39;t have anything in our color
</text>
<text start="407.419" dur="4.141">system. So basically, what, what you can do is, we</text>
<text start="411.56" dur="2.68">
already have the naming convention set for our color styles.
</text>
<text start="414.24" dur="8.79">
So we can go to our color and select style, add new style, and it will basically grab
</text>
<text start="423.03" dur="5.809">
the hex value of the rectangle we selected, and then we can label it as primary.
</text>
<text start="428.839" dur="4.871">
And when we click Create style, it&#39;ll create that style.
</text>
<text start="433.71" dur="2.609">
And when you hover over it, a tooltip will appear below it.
</text>
<text start="436.319" dur="3.671">
And it will state the name of the style that you&#39;re trying to look for.
</text>
<text start="439.99" dur="5.319">
And also, if you want to add labeling on let&#39;s say, if we create a like primary variant,
</text>
<text start="445.309" dur="4.991">
whoops, and we select this little, these little four icons, and then click Add style.
</text>
<text start="450.3" dur="5.819">
And then we do primary slash variant, this will actually add labeling.
</text>
<text start="456.119" dur="9.01">
So we&#39;ll go and it&#39;ll, you&#39;ll start to see that with with us utilizing the slash in the
</text>
<text start="465.129" dur="5.341">
name of your color style, that slash actually creates this label for you to really easily
</text>
<text start="470.47" dur="8.469">
parse information in your color styles, which is very good for, like ease of use, as opposed
</text>
<text start="478.939" dur="4.921">
to just like generating all of these colors. And then just having them side by side and
</text>
<text start="483.86" dur="3.929">
hovering, to access the name of the color you&#39;re looking for exactly.
</text>
<text start="487.789" dur="5.22">
And at least divide them into sections to get you one step closer to finding the color
</text>
<text start="493.009" dur="1.94">
you need. And I&#39;m gonna unlink that, because it&#39;s not
</text>
<text start="494.949" dur="7.111">
exactly how I want to approach it. I&#39;m actually going to go here, and if you
</text>
<text start="502.06" dur="4.059">
if you&#39;ll notice, too, and your color styles, if you haven&#39;t published them, there&#39;ll be
</text>
<text start="506.119" dur="3.431">
under local styles. And then you can access your library by going
</text>
<text start="509.55" dur="5.219">
to, if you hit Command Shift, question mark, you can type in library, and then it&#39;ll switch
</text>
<text start="514.769" dur="4.231">
you to Team library. There&#39;s also a shortcut key, option three,
</text>
<text start="519" dur="5.06">
that&#39;ll take you there and also a shortcut key option command o to access the libraries.
</text>
<text start="524.06" dur="5.579">
And you&#39;ll notice that I have 19 unpublished changes to publish.
</text>
<text start="529.639" dur="4.041">
And I can publish those, but we&#39;ll publish that once we have completed this.
</text>
<text start="533.68" dur="7.86">
And I&#39;m going to continue to create the rest of the colors as I go and label them accordingly.
</text>
<text start="541.54" dur="7.07">
Secondary, create style. And then I&#39;m going to create this as a primary
</text>
<text start="548.61" dur="6.44">variant. Create style.</text>
<text start="555.05" dur="3.99">
And one thing you can do as well in the color styles is you can actually drag and drop to
</text>
<text start="559.04" dur="3.41">
reorder the styles. So I&#39;m going to actually right click on this
</text>
<text start="562.45" dur="2.98">
one and delete style. And one thing you can do with color styles
</text>
<text start="565.43" dur="11.32">
as well is you can go in edit and add description and say this secondary color is used for x
</text>
<text start="576.75" dur="11.66">
component, x meaning the name of the component or the or like also on surfaces for x component
</text>
<text start="588.41" dur="4.14">
as an example. And then once you&#39;re once you&#39;ve completed
</text>
<text start="592.55" dur="2.58">
that you can hit back and it&#39;ll save your changes.
</text>
<text start="595.13" dur="3.3">
And then you can go back into the components like that style and you notice those changes
</text>
<text start="598.43" dur="4.09">
are now there. Which is another nice thing about colors to
</text>
<text start="602.52" dur="4.619">
get an understanding of usages behind them when using them across like, say you&#39;re designing
</text>
<text start="607.139" dur="5.311">
for a product, for example, I&#39;m going to pause this video and generate the rest of these
</text>
<text start="612.45" dur="6.639">colors. And I&#39;ll see you in a bit.</text>
<text start="619.089" dur="4.821">
So now I got everything done. You can see my color styles has local styles.
</text>
<text start="623.91" dur="7.119">
So I got the baseline of the material theme in its colors, right, and I got them all labeled
</text>
<text start="631.029" dur="3.8">
here. From the screenshot, I snapped from the website.
</text>
<text start="634.829" dur="1.831">And I basically just translated that into figma.</text>
<text start="636.66" dur="4.609">
And then I applied those styles all the way from primary to the on error surface, a lot
</text>
<text start="641.269" dur="2.851">
of them are very similar. But one thing I do not like about this approach
</text>
<text start="644.12" dur="3.44">
that I&#39;ll show you. And the next approach of applying color styles
</text>
<text start="647.56" dur="3.91">
with a consistent naming convention that clearly labels everything, when you try and access
</text>
<text start="651.47" dur="6.359">
it via the drop down menu is that this isn&#39;t very clear what I&#39;m trying to change the color,
</text>
<text start="657.829" dur="7.041">
right, I just have to hover to find the values. And a description will appear for for components
</text>
<text start="664.87" dur="5.23">
that do have a description there, which is why that tooltip was rather large for that
</text>
<text start="670.1" dur="3.21">
color style in this instance, just to provide some context behind that.
</text>
<text start="673.31" dur="3.719">
And anyways, this is just isn&#39;t clear enough for me to add color styles.
</text>
<text start="677.029" dur="12.331">
So what I&#39;m going to do is in material design 2014 established right down here in 2014,
</text>
<text start="689.36" dur="5.87">
their color palette, and it&#39;s just comprised of colors to work together harmoniously.
</text>
<text start="695.23" dur="3.599">
And basically, this is where I&#39;m going to use like a consistent naming convention and
</text>
<text start="698.829" dur="8.961">
structure based off of the, the colors given here with, with what I like to call the variables
</text>
<text start="707.79" dur="3.39">
and their hex values, which I&#39;ll then apply in figma.
</text>
<text start="711.18" dur="2.719">
And I&#39;m gonna show you how to do that with the top three.
</text>
<text start="713.899" dur="6.081">
So I&#39;m gonna go back to figma. And I&#39;m going to show you before, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="719.98" dur="8.12">
to show you, I&#39;m going to remove all this, because I don&#39;t want this anymore, I am going
</text>
<text start="728.1" dur="5.679">
to actually just leave it. And so you can see the difference between
</text>
<text start="733.779" dur="5.411">
how to navigate colors with a consistent naming convention, utilizing the slash when naming
</text>
<text start="739.19" dur="3.23">
these colors and the styles when creating them of styles.
</text>
<text start="742.42" dur="5.089">
And anyways, I&#39;m going to go here, grab my rectangle.
</text>
<text start="747.509" dur="10.63">
And I&#39;m literally just gonna actually copy this block here on background label at Red,
</text>
<text start="758.139" dur="6.881">
red, red 50 to kind of mimic the layout that we have here.
</text>
<text start="765.02" dur="3.8">
And then I&#39;m gonna hit Command D to duplicate and then option D to snap that to the right,
</text>
<text start="768.82" dur="5.11">
and then type in this hex value. And this whole process you&#39;re seeing from
</text>
<text start="773.93" dur="3.83">
me is, I&#39;m going to do it once and then I&#39;m going to pause the video and do it for the
</text>
<text start="777.76" dur="3.389">
rest. And then I&#39;ll show you how to properly label
</text>
<text start="781.149" dur="9.461">
everything as a color style in figma. And, and then I&#39;ll be back.
</text>
<text start="790.61" dur="7.56">
Alright, so I have now replicated this screenshot I&#39;ve taken from the website with the color
</text>
<text start="798.17" dur="5.979">
palette holds a portion of the color palette that material design has to offer either utilize.
</text>
<text start="804.149" dur="6.752">
And I&#39;ve just done the red, pink and purple. So now what I&#39;m going to do is start to show
</text>
<text start="810.901" dur="6.428">
you the difference and how helpful it can be by doing applying this consistent naming
</text>
<text start="817.329" dur="4.94">
convention to all the color styles we&#39;re about to create for red, pink and purple, which
</text>
<text start="822.269" dur="5.161">
you can apply to your system. So I&#39;m going to start with red, we got this
</text>
<text start="827.43" dur="6.149">
red 50 value, so we got red 50, we already have the hex value, it&#39;s gonna click add color
</text>
<text start="833.579" dur="5.68">
style, I&#39;m gonna label it read because we&#39;re gonna have a section of rats, ranging from
</text>
<text start="839.259" dur="7.051">
values of one through 900, from light to dark, and then also a 100 to a 700.
</text>
<text start="846.31" dur="5.67">
Not exactly sure what those values represent. But uh, you get where we&#39;re going with this.
</text>
<text start="851.98" dur="5.78">
And I&#39;m going to do red 100, and then specify the hex value as well.
</text>
<text start="857.76" dur="5.43">
And the color style, which is always helpful, so you don&#39;t have to actually go in and manually
</text>
<text start="863.19" dur="4.48">
apply the style and then unlink it to view the hex value, which I find quite annoying.
</text>
<text start="867.67" dur="3.71">
So we got this format, I&#39;m gonna click Create style, hit enter.
</text>
<text start="871.38" dur="4.41">
Now we got red one. So on hover, we&#39;ll see red 100 and then the
</text>
<text start="875.79" dur="2.94">
hex value. And then if you click away, you also see the
</text>
<text start="878.73" dur="7.18">
way we named it is red slash 100 dash, the hex value, which is nice and easy to parse.
</text>
<text start="885.91" dur="6.32">
And again, this is up to you and your team to decide on how you label this in terms of
</text>
<text start="892.23" dur="4.76">
like doing this for an organization for teams to utilize.
</text>
<text start="896.99" dur="5.36">
Now I&#39;m going to go in and create the rest of these Use for, for red.
</text>
<text start="902.35" dur="4.899">
It&#39;s the same process. So we got, what do we got, we created red
</text>
<text start="907.249" dur="7.311">
100 was actually supposed to be labeled red 50 actually wrote the wrong hex value as well.
</text>
<text start="914.56" dur="6.529">
So I&#39;m just gonna edit that. And it&#39;s red 50 good to go hit enter tab,
</text>
<text start="921.089" dur="3.49">
go back. Now we see that it&#39;s refined and reflects
</text>
<text start="924.579" dur="5.781">
the actual value. Okay going to do on a couple more, so you
</text>
<text start="930.36" dur="6.63">
get the idea of how to name your color styles. Now, I&#39;m going to pause it and finish reds
</text>
<text start="936.99" dur="6.48">
and then do a couple of pink and then do a couple of purple to see how effective utilizing
</text>
<text start="943.47" dur="4.239">
the slash and your color styles can parse the information when trying to access the
</text>
<text start="947.709" dur="5.79">
colors to apply to your components moving forward, when we continue to implement more
</text>
<text start="953.499" dur="8.801">
of this system as it becomes more dense. So we got red 100 here, gonna add color style.
</text>
<text start="962.3" dur="8.009">
Red 100, good to go create color styles. And we got two that fall under the red category,
</text>
<text start="970.309" dur="4.101">
because we&#39;re utilizing red space slash keeping the naming convention consistent.
</text>
<text start="974.41" dur="4.52">
So I&#39;m just gonna copy this hex value, Command click on my rectangle with the color that
</text>
<text start="978.93" dur="6.149">
I want to be a style. And then I&#39;m going to paste red 100.
</text>
<text start="985.079" dur="8.911">
But change that to 200 and then reapply the hex value for red 200 and create that style.
</text>
<text start="993.99" dur="4.75">
So now I&#39;m going to move on to creating another category which is pink.
</text>
<text start="998.74" dur="6.329">
We got I&#39;m going to copy this again, Command click and add color style.
</text>
<text start="1005.069" dur="9.281">
And I&#39;m going to go with pink space slash space 50 and then dash and then the hex value.
</text>
<text start="1014.35" dur="3.27">
Create that style. And you&#39;ll notice in the color styles now,
</text>
<text start="1017.62" dur="6.62">
we have our new our own pink section to reflect what we&#39;d like to mimic visually, but in our
</text>
<text start="1024.24" dur="5.46">
color styles, which will be accessible to everyone once you publish this, because currently
</text>
<text start="1029.7" dur="2.88">
these are local styles. As you can see, when you click somewhere random
</text>
<text start="1032.58" dur="3.46">
on the canvas, the blank canvas, you&#39;ll see the color styles here.
</text>
<text start="1036.04" dur="5.09">
But they sitting there only local but we&#39;ll push them once we&#39;re done completing this
</text>
<text start="1041.13" dur="3.51">
stew. I&#39;m going to do purple now, because I&#39;m pretty
</text>
<text start="1044.64" dur="3.63">
sure by this time you guys already know how to do this.
</text>
<text start="1048.27" dur="7.4">
As I&#39;ve done it multiple times, I&#39;m going to copy this hex value, select the background,
</text>
<text start="1055.67" dur="6.24">
add the color style, and I&#39;m going to go purple space slash add the hex value there and then
</text>
<text start="1061.91" dur="6.58">type in fifth 50 did that. Okay, enter.</text>
<text start="1068.49" dur="2.78">Now we have our sections of red, pink and purple.</text>
<text start="1071.27" dur="4.171">
The other sections we haven&#39;t implemented from the material design website, which I
</text>
<text start="1075.441" dur="5.009">
will do on my own are, are the following. As you can see, I scrolled through a lot of
</text>
<text start="1080.45" dur="4.61">
them, it will take a lot of time, but is the same exact process.
</text>
<text start="1085.06" dur="5.06">
But I will pause this video and complete that and show you and then we&#39;ll publish it once
</text>
<text start="1090.12" dur="5.82">
I&#39;m done. And that&#39;ll be the end of the video bareback.
</text>
<text start="1095.94" dur="4.51">
All right, all right. All right, I finished creating the rest of
</text>
<text start="1100.45" dur="3.35">
the color styles using the method I specified for pausing this video.
</text>
<text start="1103.8" dur="4.99">
And you can kind of see how dense this, the styles became.
</text>
<text start="1108.79" dur="6.9">
So each one of these is now a color style organized here from red, pink, and purple.
</text>
<text start="1115.69" dur="5.18">
And there&#39;s plenty more to go, I will have all of them created for you to reference as
</text>
<text start="1120.87" dur="7.01">
well, in that, by that I mean all of these, which are screenshots that will convert into
</text>
<text start="1127.88" dur="4.26">
this figma file. Take a little bit of time, but uh, it&#39;s not
</text>
<text start="1132.14" dur="4.39">
an issue. So now, the final step is publishing this.
</text>
<text start="1136.53" dur="5.25">
So what do we what? How do we do this? Well, there&#39;s a few ways I&#39;ll show you, we can select
</text>
<text start="1141.78" dur="4.85">
assets, we can click on this library icon and this little, that little blue icon right
</text>
<text start="1146.63" dur="5.78">
there in the top right corner indicates that there are publishers to be made changes, that
</text>
<text start="1152.41" dur="4.03">
publishers to be made or whatever, you can select it and you can see that you can publish
</text>
<text start="1156.44" dur="4.4">
69 changes, the 69 changes being all the color styles that we have applied to this library.
</text>
<text start="1160.84" dur="8.5">
One thing I want to show you is the the differentiation between the way we labeled these colors in
</text>
<text start="1169.34" dur="6.16">
the beginning and then the way we labeled these three sections in a much more organized
</text>
<text start="1175.5" dur="3.92">
and clear concise manner. So if we go here, create a rectangle and apply
</text>
<text start="1179.42" dur="2.73">
a color style to it. We just like this little icon here and you&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="1182.15" dur="4.18">
see that the we have these colors right The only way you can really tell what they are
</text>
<text start="1186.33" dur="5.42">
labeled as is if we hover over a mother wait to see that tooltip pop up as well.
</text>
<text start="1191.75" dur="6.43">
And what we did with the colors that we use the slash to indicate what the label was,
</text>
<text start="1198.18" dur="8.59">
to the left of the slash being the Read, and then the value being applied to the style,
</text>
<text start="1206.77" dur="3.92">
which is read 50. And then also on hover, being able to view
</text>
<text start="1210.69" dur="5.87">
the hex value as well. And we did that and split up red, pink and
</text>
<text start="1216.56" dur="5.17">
purple in a much more clear and concise manner for the user to navigate and use.
</text>
<text start="1221.73" dur="4.43">
And again, this is still somewhat troublesome because of how dense this color palette is.
</text>
<text start="1226.16" dur="6.12">
But this is the best solution I think figma has created for this and myself.
</text>
<text start="1232.28" dur="3.44">
If there&#39;s any other better ways to do this, please let me know in the comment section
</text>
<text start="1235.72" dur="1.94">below. I hope you guys found this video extremely</text>
<text start="1237.66" dur="2.35">
helpful. Thank you for your time, please leave a like,
</text>
<text start="1240.01" dur="7.09">
comment, and subscribe and follow me on GitHub. If not, I&#39;ll catch you in the next one.
</text>
<text start="1247.1" dur="3.34">
What is going on you guys, I almost forgot, we still got to publish the library.
</text>
<text start="1250.44" dur="5.75">
So I showed you multiple ways of how to publish it and use Go to View switch to Team library
</text>
<text start="1256.19" dur="2.25">or you can select this icon in the assets panel.</text>
<text start="1258.44" dur="4.68">
And another way is my favorites. My shortcut key is option command zero.
</text>
<text start="1263.12" dur="6.32">
And then you can select Publish changes. And then you can view every style that was
</text>
<text start="1269.44" dur="4.12">
either modified. So in this case, there&#39;s a bunch of removed
</text>
<text start="1273.56" dur="5.5">
ones, you know, colors that weren&#39;t very explicit. And then the colors we added, of course, and
</text>
<text start="1279.06" dur="3.25">
I&#39;m gonna hit and then you can also add a description as to what you added.
</text>
<text start="1282.31" dur="3.61">
So I&#39;m just going to be it&#39;s like a kind of like a message like a git commit message in
</text>
<text start="1285.92" dur="4.42">
a way, which will display in the version control history, once you publish this.
</text>
<text start="1290.34" dur="6.07">
So I&#39;m adding colors, adding a portion of color into the curial.
</text>
<text start="1296.41" dur="12.87">
Sign, color system to library. And then you have a message, kind of explaining
</text>
<text start="1309.28" dur="6.73">
what you did, and then publish. And then it&#39;ll add this to your library, a
</text>
<text start="1316.01" dur="6.43">
little snack bar indicating the the process successfully updated.
</text>
<text start="1322.44" dur="4.21">
And then you can view your assets. And the nice thing about it is you can view
</text>
<text start="1326.65" dur="2.66">
now if you go to material design, you can view all your colors here.
</text>
<text start="1329.31" dur="7.26">
And on hover, you can view everything. It&#39;s not as nice laid out as the colors panel
</text>
<text start="1336.57" dur="5.33">
here. But yeah, that&#39;s how you publish the colors
</text>
<text start="1341.9" dur="3.62">to your library. That is the final step.</text>
<text start="1345.52" dur="4.98">
Today I&#39;m going to show you how to create a type system figma specifically material
</text>
<text start="1350.5" dur="4.84">
designs type system, link will be in description to reference the type system material has
</text>
<text start="1355.34" dur="2.88">
created. And basically just going to give you a general
</text>
<text start="1358.22" dur="6.79">
idea of how to really develop a type system that is utilize for your content, specifically
</text>
<text start="1365.01" dur="4.43">
your components and the patterns we&#39;ll be creating here in figma.
</text>
<text start="1369.44" dur="4.56">
I also recommend messing around with this type, this type school generator, they have
</text>
<text start="1374" dur="4.82">
this nice little interactive element to the web page that allows you to really see the
</text>
<text start="1378.82" dur="5.43">
type skill and different fonts specific maybe more than likely a font family you&#39;re using,
</text>
<text start="1384.25" dur="4.8">
you could see what that looks like at scale. And if it&#39;s a great resource, figured I&#39;d
</text>
<text start="1389.05" dur="2.7">
share it. And again, I recommend going through all this.
</text>
<text start="1391.75" dur="4.17">
So basically, we&#39;re going to be going over creating this from scratch and developing
</text>
<text start="1395.92" dur="5.67">
them into type textiles in figma that are easily reasonable crasher design system and
</text>
<text start="1401.59" dur="3.75">
the one we&#39;ll be building. So let&#39;s get started.
</text>
<text start="1405.34" dur="3.78">
So I got figma open here, and you can also access this exercise file if you don&#39;t want
</text>
<text start="1409.12" dur="5.18">
to do it and just want to grab the values, I&#39;ll have that figma file, a link in description.
</text>
<text start="1414.3" dur="9.45">
So we got our our examples of the properties summed up here for all of our headers or subtitles,
</text>
<text start="1423.75" dur="4.87">
body and content, such as button caption over line, and we&#39;re basically just going to be
</text>
<text start="1428.62" dur="5.77">
applying all of these properties to our textile. So without any further ado, let&#39;s get started.
</text>
<text start="1434.39" dur="8.24">
Alright, so now that we got this, I&#39;m gonna open up my type tool here, and I&#39;m just gonna
</text>
<text start="1442.63" dur="3.74">
select type in h1. I&#39;m gonna set this to auto width because I
</text>
<text start="1446.37" dur="8.73">
don&#39;t like any unnecessary out of line space other than what&#39;s specified for the type.
</text>
<text start="1455.1" dur="6.06">
And I&#39;m just going to set this size to 96, which it already is, the line height is set
</text>
<text start="1461.16" dur="4.15">
to auto, but the letter spacing we&#39;re going to modify to negative 1.5 as specified.
</text>
<text start="1465.31" dur="8.07">
When I make sure I select that here, select my type, and then type in negative 1.5.
</text>
<text start="1473.38" dur="8.95">
Hit enter it tightened here, the kerning and or our letter spacing better word for it,
</text>
<text start="1482.33" dur="3.47">
as indicated here. But anyways, I&#39;m going to continue to build
</text>
<text start="1485.8" dur="5.45">
these type styles here. I&#39;m going to type in h2, select my typography,
</text>
<text start="1491.25" dur="5.58">
ensure that I got the letter spacing right so I don&#39;t forget and set that to negative
</text>
<text start="1496.83" dur="9.08">0.5. Hit Enter And, again, if you are confused</text>
<text start="1505.91" dur="6.16">
with anything and want to understand the properties more, you can click on this icon here with
</text>
<text start="1512.07" dur="6.26">
your text selected, the more icon and view all the properties that this typeface has
</text>
<text start="1518.33" dur="3.54">
to offer. And one important thing to note that is if
</text>
<text start="1521.87" dur="6.43">
you&#39;re using a different typeface, but creating this type system, there are features and specific
</text>
<text start="1528.3" dur="5.35">
fonts that are offered and aren&#39;t offered. So if you are seeing some features here, that
</text>
<text start="1533.65" dur="7.05">
aren&#39;t offered in a separate font you&#39;re using in in context of this video, it&#39;s probably
</text>
<text start="1540.7" dur="5.4">
because it doesn&#39;t offer the functionality. So just note that I also recommend kind of
</text>
<text start="1546.1" dur="6.1">
reading through all this is very great information. But that is for another video, if you&#39;d like
</text>
<text start="1552.2" dur="2.76">
me to make it, leave a comment in the comment section below.
</text>
<text start="1554.96" dur="4.93">
And anyways, we got our letter spacing specified, we need to change the sizing here.
</text>
<text start="1559.89" dur="4.182">
And the weight is good. And so the line height, and you can kind of
</text>
<text start="1564.072" dur="6.288">
start to see this process, very straightforward. And you repeat that, moving forward.
</text>
<text start="1570.36" dur="6.99">
The only intricate details I&#39;d say, before I zip through this is the button property.
</text>
<text start="1577.35" dur="6.42">
So if I go ahead and type in all lowercase, I can actually apply the all caps sentence
</text>
<text start="1583.77" dur="5.63">
casing in the text properties, which is fantastic. I&#39;m going to do that by selecting the uppercase
</text>
<text start="1589.4" dur="2.64">
property. And there are other properties such as lowercase
</text>
<text start="1592.04" dur="6.46">
title case, small caps, and for small caps. And I just want to note that, because I think
</text>
<text start="1598.5" dur="6.45">
that is very important for these textiles, to really optimize them.
</text>
<text start="1604.95" dur="6.45">
So we&#39;re gonna go to letter spacing, and implement add in 1.25, we&#39;ve got the letter spacing
</text>
<text start="1611.4" dur="4.46">
set. Now we&#39;re just gonna change the size and weight
</text>
<text start="1615.86" dur="8.72">
set to medium. And now we have our all caps in the button,
</text>
<text start="1624.58" dur="3.49">
we don&#39;t even have to hold down Shift, which is fantastic.
</text>
<text start="1628.07" dur="6.91">
And one other minute change here. For this textiles, we&#39;re going to of course,
</text>
<text start="1634.98" dur="9.25">
change the size and weight. But most of all, we go to the text properties
</text>
<text start="1644.23" dur="11.38">
we&#39;re gonna change the case to for small caps to be in line with the case here, just because
</text>
<text start="1655.61" dur="5.99">
the font size is so small set to 10. And other than that you guys can go ahead
</text>
<text start="1661.6" dur="6.44">
and make the rest of these also will have this file and the description below.
</text>
<text start="1668.04" dur="9.09">
So I&#39;ll be right back with all these textiles. Alright, so now I know I&#39;ve got all the textiles
</text>
<text start="1677.13" dur="4.56">
created with a proper properties. I hope you did that exercise too.
</text>
<text start="1681.69" dur="4.4">
And anyways, now we&#39;re gonna go about organizing our styles and then publishing them, and that&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="1686.09" dur="4.86">
be the rest of the video. So we&#39;re gonna be utilizing the way figma
</text>
<text start="1690.95" dur="8.91">
structures accessing textiles, there&#39;s a really nice way to like, thoroughly separate all
</text>
<text start="1699.86" dur="5.26">
the header content from the subtitles from the body as well as the textiles for other
</text>
<text start="1705.12" dur="4.34">
types of content, such as buttons, and captions and over lines.
</text>
<text start="1709.46" dur="7.03">
So I&#39;m just going to go here, select my textile, click on this icon, click the plus button
</text>
<text start="1716.49" dur="4.4">
to create a style. And I&#39;m going to type in headers slash.
</text>
<text start="1720.89" dur="5.76">
And with the slash naming convention, it&#39;s actually going to allow me to separate out
</text>
<text start="1726.65" dur="3.68">
my textiles by category. So we&#39;re going to have our headers and subtitles
</text>
<text start="1730.33" dur="5.96">
and body and separate as well as the content such as buttons, caption or lines.
</text>
<text start="1736.29" dur="6.96">
So I&#39;m going to specify this h1 here. And then it&#39;s going to add this little dot
</text>
<text start="1743.25" dur="1.95">here to separate it. So I got my h1.</text>
<text start="1745.2" dur="7.01">
And you can also specify the weight of the font, which is this h1 is a light h1 in case
</text>
<text start="1752.21" dur="4.48">
you have variants of h1 later on down the road for specific reasons.
</text>
<text start="1756.69" dur="6.13">
And one thing we can also specify is the size here are sizes 96.
</text>
<text start="1762.82" dur="6.94">
And I like to what that you can do is use this divider and specify the line height in
</text>
<text start="1769.76" dur="3.81">
relation to the size of your font, which is also very important.
</text>
<text start="1773.57" dur="3.05">But I have all of these set to auto here in figma.</text>
<text start="1776.62" dur="5.49">
But for example, you could write auto or specify the line height.
</text>
<text start="1782.11" dur="6.34">
And again, when you create that style, it will now appear under headers whenever you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="1788.45" dur="3.9">
trying to apply a style. Say I want to apply style now.
</text>
<text start="1792.35" dur="5.38">
It&#39;s under this category name headers. And once this is more fleshed out, it&#39;ll be
</text>
<text start="1797.73" dur="3.46">
much easier to see the organization of a The content.
</text>
<text start="1801.19" dur="8.801">
So I&#39;m going to go ahead here and create the same exact thing for my headers, the rest
</text>
<text start="1809.991" dur="5.479">
of my headers again using the slash convention, specifying that it&#39;s an h2.
</text>
<text start="1815.47" dur="5.68">
And it uses the weight light. And the font size is 60.
</text>
<text start="1821.15" dur="6.45">
And the line height is set to auto. And again, for your systems are probably going
</text>
<text start="1827.6" dur="6.04">
to be more specific the line height, but in this example, I&#39;m not going to get to the
</text>
<text start="1833.64" dur="4.82">
gritty in that regard. So create that style, you notice that it updates
</text>
<text start="1838.46" dur="14.27">
here, we&#39;re gonna populate that again, got that h3, specify the weight again, and specify
</text>
<text start="1852.73" dur="5.65">the size. And of course, the line height.</text>
<text start="1858.38" dur="5.43">
So you can see continues to populate. And now I&#39;m going to go ahead and finish the
</text>
<text start="1863.81" dur="3.9">
rest of this. I&#39;ll create one subtitle to so you can see
</text>
<text start="1867.71" dur="5.91">
the differentiation of categorization between two different categories, which will be our
</text>
<text start="1873.62" dur="6.23">
headers and subtitles. So I&#39;m gonna go get here, add the style, label,
</text>
<text start="1879.85" dur="11.78">
subtitle, subtitle and one, specify the weight, just regular.
</text>
<text start="1891.63" dur="4.35">
And then of course, the size of that font. And I don&#39;t know, off the top of my head,
</text>
<text start="1895.98" dur="5.9">
but I will leave it set to six subtitle set to 16, which it is, and the line height set
</text>
<text start="1901.88" dur="2.7">auto. So here you can see now that your textiles</text>
<text start="1904.58" dur="4.07">
are organized. Here, clearly, and I&#39;m gonna go ahead and
</text>
<text start="1908.65" dur="5.3">
finish the rest of this. And I&#39;ll be right back.
</text>
<text start="1913.95" dur="3.21">
All right, so now we got all our content set up and organized.
</text>
<text start="1917.16" dur="6.59">
So you can see that I&#39;ve now spliced these into what does that 344 categories, we got
</text>
<text start="1923.75" dur="5.35">
the headers with the subtitles, and we&#39;ve got the body and the content.
</text>
<text start="1929.1" dur="4.56">
And one textile I&#39;m actually missing is this subtitle, what&#39;s going on here, let me just
</text>
<text start="1933.66" dur="4.91">
above this real quick. We&#39;ve got subtitle, subtitle, subtitle wanted
</text>
<text start="1938.57" dur="4.02">
to, oh, there we go. I&#39;m just going to organize that real quick.
</text>
<text start="1942.59" dur="3.79">
There we go. So in the order in which you create your textiles
</text>
<text start="1946.38" dur="7.41">
is how it will appear in the hierarchy. So you may have to organize that.
</text>
<text start="1953.79" dur="6.18">
And now when we go ahead and create a textile, I mean create, when we need to apply a textile,
</text>
<text start="1959.97" dur="4.16">
we can go here, look at our textiles. And now they&#39;re beautifully organized in a
</text>
<text start="1964.13" dur="4.52">
clear, concise manner. And not only are they organized, each textiles
</text>
<text start="1968.65" dur="7.82">
named in such a way that it it&#39;s easy to specify the size, and the line height as well.
</text>
<text start="1976.47" dur="4.47">
And again, I just have that set auto. Um, you could also make that the letter spacing
</text>
<text start="1980.94" dur="3.57">
here if you wanted to depends on how technical you really need to be.
</text>
<text start="1984.51" dur="4.59">
And that&#39;s how you do that. And now our last step is publishing this to
</text>
<text start="1989.1" dur="5.85">
our library. So now I got 26 changes to publish here.
</text>
<text start="1994.95" dur="5.2">
And for those who do not know how to use this, this is basically like a git commit.
</text>
<text start="2000.15" dur="4.86">
For those of you who are developers ignore all of these removed textiles, these are old.
</text>
<text start="2005.01" dur="8.01">
And at here, you&#39;ll be able to see all the changes that you&#39;ve created, which are all
</text>
<text start="2013.02" dur="5.6">
the textiles you&#39;ve added. And we can write a description.
</text>
<text start="2018.62" dur="10.81">
adding text styles to design system. This is very vague, but give you a general
</text>
<text start="2029.43" dur="4.53">
idea how to do that. And again, you can view all the changes made,
</text>
<text start="2033.96" dur="4.29">
and everything that is unchanged here below. And then and you can publish.
</text>
<text start="2038.25" dur="5.4">
And the nice thing about leaving comments is that it leaves a trail to track any history.
</text>
<text start="2043.65" dur="6.63">
So if we go to show version history here, by clicking this carrot, click Show version
</text>
<text start="2050.28" dur="5.95">
history, we can see that we just published our textiles and we left that message.
</text>
<text start="2056.23" dur="3.74">
So we can actually go to that point in time by clicking on it.
</text>
<text start="2059.97" dur="4.75">
And it will take us there. Or we could go even further back to a point
</text>
<text start="2064.72" dur="6.13">
in time where these weren&#39;t even created. So if I click on 6:47pm, it&#39;s going to load
</text>
<text start="2070.85" dur="4.63">
and I&#39;m viewing the time this autosave at 6:47pm.
</text>
<text start="2075.48" dur="1.89">And you can see that there are no textiles here.</text>
<text start="2077.37" dur="4.66">
And you can&#39;t edit this version. But say you needed to, you could duplicate
</text>
<text start="2082.03" dur="5.19">
this and then go to that duplicate file and grab what you need and then bring it into
</text>
<text start="2087.22" dur="3.081">
the current version. And if you hit escape, you can get back to
</text>
<text start="2090.301" dur="2.368">
your current version or you can click the button edit current version.
</text>
<text start="2092.669" dur="4.321">
And if you&#39;re lost, I&#39;d hit two under keyboards the shortcut key to fit everything, everything
</text>
<text start="2096.99" dur="7.1">
in your canvas to your frame and Now we found ourselves back here, with all our textiles
</text>
<text start="2104.09" dur="3.69">here, not local anymore. Now published.</text>
<text start="2107.78" dur="4.134">
So now designers can actually access this in their panel here, we go to, I got mine
</text>
<text start="2111.914" dur="5.556">
set to materials on here with all my colors published and my textiles.
</text>
<text start="2117.47" dur="6.46">
Today we&#39;re talking about elevation and material design and how it&#39;s utilized.
</text>
<text start="2123.93" dur="6.26">
So we&#39;ll be doing an overview of elevation, which will entail elevation depicting, understanding
</text>
<text start="2130.19" dur="7.08">
depicting elevation, the elevation hierarchy, and the default elevation set for components.
</text>
<text start="2137.27" dur="4.66">
And I have some documentation that I grabbed off of material designs website, which you
</text>
<text start="2141.93" dur="4.56">
can also access by clicking on this and the exercise file and clicking open link.
</text>
<text start="2146.49" dur="6.39">
And then you&#39;ll then get access to the elevation page in material design, where it discusses
</text>
<text start="2152.88" dur="4.4">
all of this, and as covered in the contents here in depth.
</text>
<text start="2157.28" dur="4.77">
And essentially, elevation is the relative distance between two surfaces along the z
</text>
<text start="2162.05" dur="5.2">axis. So what is the z axis? Well, we go ahead and</text>
<text start="2167.25" dur="3.62">
Google search that. And for those of you who are beginners to
</text>
<text start="2170.87" dur="5.17">
this and don&#39;t understand the z axis, it is the third access usually representing depth
</text>
<text start="2176.04" dur="6.04">
on a three dimensional grid. It can be used in charts or graphs, and whatnot,
</text>
<text start="2182.08" dur="4.801">
typically, in a Cartesian coordinate system, and the z axis is perpendicular to both the
</text>
<text start="2186.881" dur="7.009">
x and y axis, and is used to plot the value of z, the third and unknown in mathematics,
</text>
<text start="2193.89" dur="4.35">
which is, which is good to know. And anyways, how this translates in figma
</text>
<text start="2198.24" dur="5.06">
is basically the hierarchy. And in the in the layers, you can think of
</text>
<text start="2203.3" dur="5.39">
as like the hierarchy in the Layers panel, say, for example, I have a frame here.
</text>
<text start="2208.69" dur="6.64">
And then I have a couple of shapes. And I&#39;m going to offset this color here.
</text>
<text start="2215.33" dur="7.62">
And currently, the shapes are being basically utilize the Z index.
</text>
<text start="2222.95" dur="4.56">
And you notice that because this rectangle, when I overlap it over the rectangle above
</text>
<text start="2227.51" dur="5.37">
it visually, this gray rectangle, and I add this red rectangle there, you&#39;ll notice that
</text>
<text start="2232.88" dur="6.501">
this red rectangle is higher up on the Z index in and also you can think of that in the layer
</text>
<text start="2239.381" dur="5.269">
order as well, I can even change that and drag it below this gray rectangle, meaning
</text>
<text start="2244.65" dur="5.62">
that it&#39;s now lower on the Z index the red rectangle, and you can go ahead and move that
</text>
<text start="2250.27" dur="6.71">
around and understand that that is the Z index that is representing the layer order here.
</text>
<text start="2256.98" dur="5.09">
And basically, what material design does is that it has a set of components.
</text>
<text start="2262.07" dur="5.03">
And here you can see a set of default elevation values for all kinds of components.
</text>
<text start="2267.1" dur="6.21">
And here, we have all of the elevations. Values that will turn into styles as they
</text>
<text start="2273.31" dur="4.47">
already are in this figma file locally. And we&#39;re gonna go ahead and create a couple
</text>
<text start="2277.78" dur="4.13">
of them from scratch so you understand how they&#39;re built as styles.
</text>
<text start="2281.91" dur="5.97">
And we&#39;ll also go ahead and do a brief overview about how those are made based off of reading
</text>
<text start="2287.88" dur="6.3">
the documentation. So here, again, elevation is measured in dips.
</text>
<text start="2294.18" dur="5.68">
And in elevation elevation material design is measuring the distance between surfaces.
</text>
<text start="2299.86" dur="5.39">
As you can see here, they&#39;re giving you a representation of what this z index looks
</text>
<text start="2305.25" dur="9.71">
like, by us utilizing this graph here, this format to indicate how far a surface is from
</text>
<text start="2314.96" dur="5">
one another. But again, to us, it looks horrible to us
</text>
<text start="2319.96" dur="6.37">
visually it is we&#39;re seeing this horse on this flat surface on the screen.
</text>
<text start="2326.33" dur="4.37">
But if you were to tilt that view sideways, you could say, this is what that would look
</text>
<text start="2330.7" dur="5.75">
like in the scenario where this example number two indicates that there&#39;s a surface that
</text>
<text start="2336.45" dur="8.86">
is one dip set to one dip elevation, and then the other surface is set to eight dip elevation,
</text>
<text start="2345.31" dur="5.31">
as viewed from from the side view here. And the difference between the two surfaces
</text>
<text start="2350.62" dur="8.18">
is seven dips as viewed from the side angle. And you can represent that with using a drop
</text>
<text start="2358.8" dur="5.39">
shadow. And that will indicate the elevation and the
</text>
<text start="2364.19" dur="5.57">
distance between these two surfaces. So here&#39;s the one dip here in this rectangle,
</text>
<text start="2369.76" dur="2.92">and then which is represented from the side view.</text>
<text start="2372.68" dur="9.1">
And then here is elevation being expressed at a higher elevation, using eight dips with
</text>
<text start="2381.78" dur="6.45">
much more visual emphasis on the drop shadow as you can see, and that&#39;s also represented
</text>
<text start="2388.23" dur="5.43">
here from the side. And there&#39;s that distance Express there.
</text>
<text start="2393.66" dur="5.64">
And there&#39;s another more complicated example are both surfaces A and B are at the same
</text>
<text start="2399.3" dur="5.8">
elevation a nBw are set to eight dip elevation, and they cast different shadows because surface
</text>
<text start="2405.1" dur="4.42">
B is in front of another surface that already has elevation.
</text>
<text start="2409.52" dur="4.17">
As you can see, the surface c already has elevation set to four dips.
</text>
<text start="2413.69" dur="5.12">
And then on top of that surface B is set to eight dips, as you can see as represented
</text>
<text start="2418.81" dur="7.341">
from the side here, whereas the surface a is just doesn&#39;t have anything below it.
</text>
<text start="2426.151" dur="8.559">
And it is set to eight dips of elevation. So a and b are essentially on the same axis
</text>
<text start="2434.71" dur="5.83">
elevation, it&#39;s just that it doesn&#39;t have any other surface below it.
</text>
<text start="2440.54" dur="7.82">
And you can understand the elevation system, again, is utilized in components and all material
</text>
<text start="2448.36" dur="5.48">
design surfaces and components have elevation values, and surfaces at different elevations
</text>
<text start="2453.84" dur="4.48">
do different things. And those things being allowing surfaces to
</text>
<text start="2458.32" dur="6.07">
move in front of and behind other surfaces such as content scrolling behind app bars,
</text>
<text start="2464.39" dur="5.08">
and reflecting spatial relationships such as how floating action buttons shadow indicates
</text>
<text start="2469.47" dur="4.76">
it is separate from a card and focusing attention on the highest elevation.
</text>
<text start="2474.23" dur="5.69">
This is commonly seen in components such as dialogues, which temporarily appear in front
</text>
<text start="2479.92" dur="1.9">
of other surfaces. And we&#39;re gonna go ahead and look at some
</text>
<text start="2481.82" dur="6.16">
great examples of how these components are in some motion examples.
</text>
<text start="2487.98" dur="5.63">
But here is a great example of resting elevation, where the by default, this card component
</text>
<text start="2493.61" dur="11.92">
here has elevation at the by default app set to one dip.
</text>
<text start="2505.53" dur="6.45">
And then once it is once there&#39;s an action taken upon it, sometimes the elevation can
</text>
<text start="2511.98" dur="3.12">change. So it is important to know so for example</text>
<text start="2515.1" dur="4.49">
with a button, the elevation will change based upon when you press it.
</text>
<text start="2519.59" dur="5.19">
So here in this example, when it when someone is pressing on this button, you&#39;ll see that
</text>
<text start="2524.78" dur="5.04">
from the side, it goes from two dips to eight dips based on that action which raises it
</text>
<text start="2529.82" dur="6.16">
to the surface, making this a much more immersive experience and interactive, also conveying
</text>
<text start="2535.98" dur="7.86">
certain key interactions and progression to the user as they are communicating with their
</text>
<text start="2543.84" dur="4.21">
product, which is built on top of material design, for example.
</text>
<text start="2548.05" dur="7.43">
And here you can talk you can see other examples of elevation here with this card, as it is
</text>
<text start="2555.48" dur="7.31">
being dragged, it goes from one dip elevation to eight, and is then revisit and then rises
</text>
<text start="2562.79" dur="5.66">
above the previous card as it&#39;s above it in the Z index.
</text>
<text start="2568.45" dur="8.84">
And here&#39;s another example of when you would utilize elevation where these cards are scrolling.
</text>
<text start="2577.29" dur="9.931">
And being on that elevation based system is allowed to scroll over the surface that it
</text>
<text start="2587.221" dur="7.629">
is currently above that you can see there. And you can also read other important things,
</text>
<text start="2594.85" dur="5.63">
such as understanding the surface overlaps on top of other surfaces, and when to use
</text>
<text start="2600.48" dur="5.19">
them, which is really important. And also when to use a scrim background in
</text>
<text start="2605.67" dur="5.12">
the UI to express that the content above it is at a higher elevation also to provide more
</text>
<text start="2610.79" dur="7.77">
emphasis on the most primary calls to action in that moment in time.
</text>
<text start="2618.56" dur="3.3">
And again, more great in depth analysis on elevation.
</text>
<text start="2621.86" dur="5.82">
And when it when you can use motion elevation together, as for example, showing changes
</text>
<text start="2627.68" dur="5.43">
in shadow or displaying overlap, or pushing content around or scaling that content or
</text>
<text start="2633.11" dur="4.35">
using parallax scrolling. And what we&#39;re going to get to now is understanding
</text>
<text start="2637.46" dur="6.69">
elevation hierarchy. And basically going over the diagram of default
</text>
<text start="2644.15" dur="3.5">
elevation values, which is super important. And we have that in figma.
</text>
<text start="2647.65" dur="4.02">
Now that we went over all that. So we have this set of elevation values, which
</text>
<text start="2651.67" dur="6.11">
tells us exactly what components have default elevation values.
</text>
<text start="2657.78" dur="3.71">
And this will be super important to implement into our color styles.
</text>
<text start="2661.49" dur="7.45">
So in this figma file I&#39;ve already created. I&#39;ve already created a set of elevation values
</text>
<text start="2668.94" dur="8.64">
and they&#39;re already effect styles in in your figma file, this exercise file.
</text>
<text start="2677.58" dur="3.84">
And again, this is the final result of what we&#39;ll be baking, but I don&#39;t just want to
</text>
<text start="2681.42" dur="3.11">
just hand this off to and actually show you how to create these effects style.
</text>
<text start="2684.53" dur="3.5">
So we&#39;ll go ahead and create a few of them and then and then I&#39;ll pause this video and
</text>
<text start="2688.03" dur="4.58">
have you built the rest by yourself. So first I need to teach you how to actually
</text>
<text start="2692.61" dur="4.05">
evaluate the values within each of these drop shadows.
</text>
<text start="2696.66" dur="3.63">
So here you can see these are all the elevation values used in material design.
</text>
<text start="2700.29" dur="4.59">
And again, this one isn&#39;t. This one&#39;s at the the surface level, this
</text>
<text start="2704.88" dur="4.9">
doesn&#39;t utilize elevation as you can see, set to 00 dip.
</text>
<text start="2709.78" dur="4.78">
And that then can&#39;t be in effect style because it doesn&#39;t use any effects.
</text>
<text start="2714.56" dur="3.61">
That is just the flat the baseline, just think of 00 as the baseline.
</text>
<text start="2718.17" dur="6.35">
And then, of course, one dip is used for the search bar cards at a rested elevation state
</text>
<text start="2724.52" dur="3.55">
by default, as well as the search bar at a rested elevation state.
</text>
<text start="2728.07" dur="5.95">
And also switch components. And text buttons are set to zero and standard
</text>
<text start="2734.02" dur="7.69">
side sheet components are set to zero as well. So let&#39;s go ahead and make this I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="2741.71" dur="3.38">
to copy this. And you&#39;ll notice that it is attached to the
</text>
<text start="2745.09" dur="6.35">
style, I&#39;m going to go ahead and detach that. And you&#39;ll notice that these styles are all
</text>
<text start="2751.44" dur="2.64">
drop shadow. So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and remove all these.
</text>
<text start="2754.08" dur="4.96">
So now this is flat here on the right, and one thing we can do is we can manually go
</text>
<text start="2759.04" dur="3.93">
in and click on these individual styles, which is very tedious.
</text>
<text start="2762.97" dur="4.07">
And we can go ahead and do it that way. So if I click on this value, so for example,
</text>
<text start="2767.04" dur="4.93">
I could screenshot all of these, because I wouldn&#39;t want to go back and forth, clicking
</text>
<text start="2771.97" dur="3.97">
on all these drop shadows, and copying, pasting these properties.
</text>
<text start="2775.94" dur="3.27">
So I&#39;m going to show you the long way of doing this.
</text>
<text start="2779.21" dur="5.94">
And then I&#39;m going to show you the fast way, so you never do that approach again.
</text>
<text start="2785.15" dur="7.05">
So let me just undo that there. Then I&#39;m going to paste this, here we go.
</text>
<text start="2792.2" dur="4.83">
So I&#39;m going to grab this last drop shadow style.
</text>
<text start="2797.03" dur="4.22">
And then with that drop shadow style set, I have all three drop shadows, and I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="2801.25" dur="8.17">
to recreate the elevation set for 01 dips. So I&#39;m going to go ahead and click on effects.
</text>
<text start="2809.42" dur="6.52">
Whoops, I&#39;m gonna click the Create effect style icon I have, by default, it selects
</text>
<text start="2815.94" dur="3.51">
drop shadow, and it&#39;ll give you some default values.
</text>
<text start="2819.45" dur="2.05">
So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and create this one here.
</text>
<text start="2821.5" dur="8.15">
So I&#39;m going to change the blur to one, and this and that, I&#39;m going to set the y axis
</text>
<text start="2829.65" dur="4.35">
value to one here. And then I&#39;m going to keep the spread at zero
</text>
<text start="2834" dur="6.57">
and change the opacity to 14%. And it&#39;s using a color of black, which is
</text>
<text start="2840.57" dur="4.081">000000. And then now I have that first drop shadow</text>
<text start="2844.651" dur="4.709">
style created, you can start to see that this drop shadow is being applied here, but it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2849.36" dur="4.57">
very light in the drop shadow color compared to this one where it&#39;s much more sharp and
</text>
<text start="2853.93" dur="4.93">
darker on the edges of the rectangle. And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and create that second
</text>
<text start="2858.86" dur="5.13">
drop shadow. And with that, I&#39;m going to just mimic the
</text>
<text start="2863.99" dur="6.29">
properties in this drop shadow. And that&#39;s set to one on the blur, zero on
</text>
<text start="2870.28" dur="8.26">
the spread, and two on the y axis and an opacity of 12% going to hit enter, I know that second
</text>
<text start="2878.54" dur="4.28">
property of drop shadows applied, then I&#39;m going to go ahead and delete these two, so
</text>
<text start="2882.82" dur="7.35">
I don&#39;t get confused and create my last effect, which is another set of drop shadow, I&#39;m gonna
</text>
<text start="2890.17" dur="7.62">
go ahead and apply these values again. So one on the y axis, three on the blur, zero
</text>
<text start="2897.79" dur="4.24">
spread and 20% opacity. Once I&#39;ve created that, you&#39;ll notice I now
</text>
<text start="2902.03" dur="4.52">have an exact replica of the drop shadow. Here.</text>
<text start="2906.55" dur="9.14">
The only difference is that this drop shadow is brand new, it&#39;s still the drop shadow from
</text>
<text start="2915.69" dur="4.05">
material design system. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s not attached to a style
</text>
<text start="2919.74" dur="5">
for learning purposes, specifically, so you know how to create these drop shadows.
</text>
<text start="2924.74" dur="4.43">
And we can go ahead and turn this into a style. But before we turn this into a style, let&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2929.17" dur="7.68">
go ahead and show you the easy way to do this. So if we now that we have this style, maybe
</text>
<text start="2936.85" dur="6.73">
we go ahead and duplicate the eight dip based version of this, and it&#39;s still attached to
</text>
<text start="2943.58" dur="5.49">
a, an effect style. So I&#39;m going to detach that style.
</text>
<text start="2949.07" dur="5.13">
I&#39;m going to duplicate this rectangle. And I&#39;m going to delete all these drop shadows.
</text>
<text start="2954.2" dur="4.09">
And what I&#39;m gonna do is make sure I have my rectangle selected, and I&#39;m going to hold
</text>
<text start="2958.29" dur="4.91">
down Option Command C. And what that allows me to do is copy all
</text>
<text start="2963.2" dur="6.409">
of the styles associated with the object I selected, which is the rectangle and then
</text>
<text start="2969.609" dur="5.531">
I can paste those over to my new style new object by clicking on this rectangle and then
</text>
<text start="2975.14" dur="4.27">
hitting option Command V. And it pastes those exact drop shadow values.
</text>
<text start="2979.41" dur="4.11">
You notice that when I pasted it, it implemented those new drop shadow values.
</text>
<text start="2983.52" dur="4.75">
And that is much quicker than going in and implementing the manually like I did, and
</text>
<text start="2988.27" dur="2.4">
referencing screenshots. So I didn&#39;t have to individually click on
</text>
<text start="2990.67" dur="4.59">
each drop shadow property panel and then do that one by one.
</text>
<text start="2995.26" dur="4.97">
That&#39;s very annoying. So with that being said, let&#39;s utilize That
</text>
<text start="3000.23" dur="8.44">
approach now. So here, we can just copy over, I&#39;m command
</text>
<text start="3008.67" dur="6.33">
clicking on all the command clicking to select the rectangle specifically, and then holding
</text>
<text start="3015" dur="4.05">
Shift Command click on all of these rectangles here.
</text>
<text start="3019.05" dur="4.809">
And basically what I&#39;m doing is grabbing all of these, and then I&#39;m going to hold down
</text>
<text start="3023.859" dur="5.161">Option and drag these over to copy all of them.</text>
<text start="3029.02" dur="6.13">
And you&#39;ll notice what we have here is all of these elevation values, or effects, all
</text>
<text start="3035.15" dur="2.56">
of these rectangles are attached to effects styles.
</text>
<text start="3037.71" dur="6.25">
But we don&#39;t want to do that we want to utilize the method of creating drop shadows quickly
</text>
<text start="3043.96" dur="7.26">
make copies of properties and pasting them. And to do that, we need to go ahead and unlink
</text>
<text start="3051.22" dur="6.19">
detach all these drop shadow styles. So here we go, we&#39;re going to continue to
</text>
<text start="3057.41" dur="5.06">
detach these styles, I&#39;m just selecting each one individually, as you can&#39;t bulk select
</text>
<text start="3062.47" dur="3.83">
these and detach, unfortunately, for effect styles.
</text>
<text start="3066.3" dur="6.9">
But you can do that with color styles. So now that we have that applied, I know that
</text>
<text start="3073.2" dur="3.89">these are all in sequential order or proper order.</text>
<text start="3077.09" dur="11.57">
So it goes from one dip, elevation, 234-689-1216, and 24.
</text>
<text start="3088.66" dur="7.34">
So all I&#39;m going to do is duplicate this real quick.
</text>
<text start="3096" dur="5.67">
And before I detach all these drop shadow values, and I&#39;m gonna duplicate that again,
</text>
<text start="3101.67" dur="7.61">
and keep duplicating them on the rectangles I have not created.
</text>
<text start="3109.28" dur="4.76">
drop shadows for yet. And you&#39;ll notice that they&#39;re all very flat,
</text>
<text start="3114.04" dur="3.27">
which would mean that they&#39;re using the zero dip elevation essentially.
</text>
<text start="3117.31" dur="5.9">
And I&#39;m just gonna go ahead and click on these command options, option C, and then select
</text>
<text start="3123.21" dur="5.159">
the object I want to paste the drop shadow to and then click Command Option v.
</text>
<text start="3128.369" dur="6.421">
And you&#39;ll notice that I am now just essentially copying and pasting these effects style properties.
</text>
<text start="3134.79" dur="4.151">
So holding down option, Command C, selecting the new object and then do an option Command
</text>
<text start="3138.941" dur="3.689">
V. And I&#39;m just grabbing all of these drop shadow
</text>
<text start="3142.63" dur="6.2">
properties and pasting them very quickly. And this is something you can use for colors
</text>
<text start="3148.83" dur="4.17">
as well. So if I change the color of this, it would
</text>
<text start="3153" dur="5.16">
copy that color value, it still has the drop shadow, but if I option Command C, and then
</text>
<text start="3158.16" dur="6.19">
select my new object, and then option Command V, it also copies over that fill value.
</text>
<text start="3164.35" dur="5.36">
So it copies all the properties not just the effect styles, which are the drop shadows
</text>
<text start="3169.71" dur="3.149">
in our case. So do take note of that object, Command C,
</text>
<text start="3172.859" dur="4.831">
select menu object object, Command V, and then do the same thing for the last set of
</text>
<text start="3177.69" dur="2.88">elevation. And this is very important to note.</text>
<text start="3180.57" dur="4.78">
And now that we built all of this out, we can go ahead and create effect styles out
</text>
<text start="3185.35" dur="3.59">
of these. And as you can see, we already have them created.
</text>
<text start="3188.94" dur="5.74">
So we can go ahead and mimic a couple. And I&#39;m going to go ahead and this is our
</text>
<text start="3194.68" dur="3.731">
zero to dip effect style. So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and click on my style
</text>
<text start="3198.411" dur="6.359">
icon and click add new style. And then I&#39;m going to type in zero to dip.
</text>
<text start="3204.77" dur="6.42">
And this is our new effect style. And we now will have two variants of that.
</text>
<text start="3211.19" dur="5.63">
And then it gets created and it&#39;s set at the bottom.
</text>
<text start="3216.82" dur="6.07">
The newest styles are then generated at the bottom of this list in the effect styles and
</text>
<text start="3222.89" dur="4.01">
the Properties panel, I can even go ahead and just create another one, you&#39;ll notice
</text>
<text start="3226.9" dur="5.09">
that this is now linked to a style. And these aren&#39;t yet because I haven&#39;t created
</text>
<text start="3231.99" dur="3.36">
the color styles. I&#39;m gonna go ahead and click on another one,
</text>
<text start="3235.35" dur="2.9">and click on the style icon and create new style.</text>
<text start="3238.25" dur="5.56">
And this is my 24 dip elevation base value. So I got 24 dip there, we&#39;ll click Create
</text>
<text start="3243.81" dur="8.54">
style, I now have zero to dip and 24 dip created. But this is solely to showcase you to showcase
</text>
<text start="3252.35" dur="3.71">
to you how to create styles out of these elevation values because you&#39;re going to reuse them
</text>
<text start="3256.06" dur="2.93">
time and time again. So I&#39;m just gonna actually delete these since
</text>
<text start="3258.99" dur="3.98">
we already have them in our file. Now that you know how to create effect styles
</text>
<text start="3262.97" dur="4.25">
in figma. And with that being said, the only thing missing
</text>
<text start="3267.22" dur="7.889">
from these effects styles is documentation. And basically what I&#39;m referencing is that
</text>
<text start="3275.109" dur="5.101">
in these effects styles, we can go ahead and label where this elevation would apply.
</text>
<text start="3280.21" dur="4.8">
So I&#39;m going to click on 24 dip and since we have the table of default elevation values,
</text>
<text start="3285.01" dur="3.78">
it tells me where what components use that set of elevation.
</text>
<text start="3288.79" dur="4.7">
So I can go ahead and click on this edit style icon and add a description.
</text>
<text start="3293.49" dur="9.18">
You and I can type in use for dialogue components and I&#39;m going to hit tab and it&#39;ll save that
</text>
<text start="3302.67" dur="5.929">
change, I&#39;m going to hit back, I&#39;m going to go ahead and select my 16 dip, the fix style,
</text>
<text start="3308.599" dur="4.281">
click Edit style. And I&#39;m going to continue to add the description.
</text>
<text start="3312.88" dur="4.94">
And currently met navigation drawer components and modal bottom sheet.
</text>
<text start="3317.82" dur="4.55">
And modal side sheet components use this default elevation value.
</text>
<text start="3322.37" dur="6.92">
So I&#39;m going to actually go ahead and input that used for these components and have been
</text>
<text start="3329.29" dur="10.03">
the navigation drawer. And modal bottom sheet and modal side sheet.
</text>
<text start="3339.32" dur="6.26">
And now that I have that input, it will save that and you can even go back into your, your
</text>
<text start="3345.58" dur="3.35">
style and edit it and check to see if it saved the description.
</text>
<text start="3348.93" dur="5.41">
I&#39;m going to going to continue to input the description so that way when you publish this
</text>
<text start="3354.34" dur="5.73">
and other designers start to use these styles, they can go ahead and and click on this scription
</text>
<text start="3360.07" dur="6.26">
understand where you would actually apply this elevation style, which is great, useful
</text>
<text start="3366.33" dur="6.53">
tool to communicate to your designer, especially when you don&#39;t designers don&#39;t remember where
</text>
<text start="3372.86" dur="6.249">
these styles are being utilized. And here you can see that a lot of components
</text>
<text start="3379.109" dur="6.881">
use the default elevation value of eight dips. And I&#39;m going to go ahead and pause this video
</text>
<text start="3385.99" dur="7.28">
and I want you to go ahead and for the rest of these for the eight dips 64321 dip melt
</text>
<text start="3393.27" dur="5.66">
effects styles, I want you to go ahead and reference this table here and input that into
</text>
<text start="3398.93" dur="3.54">
the description like we just did for for the following effects styles.
</text>
<text start="3402.47" dur="4.73">
I&#39;m going to pause this video and I&#39;ll catch you when this is done.
</text>
<text start="3407.2" dur="3.89">
So now I have completed inputting all the descriptions for the rest of the elevation
</text>
<text start="3411.09" dur="2.45">
values. As you can see here, it&#39;s a direct reflection
</text>
<text start="3413.54" dur="5.499">
of what is labeled in the table of default elevation values and material design.
</text>
<text start="3419.039" dur="4.131">
And again, I got these screenshots off of the material design elevation page, which
</text>
<text start="3423.17" dur="4.81">
is also a link here and exercise file if you want to double check things, and also soak
</text>
<text start="3427.98" dur="6.11">
in more information on on elevation itself. Because this is not only applicable to material
</text>
<text start="3434.09" dur="4.62">
designs design system, but great principles for you to utilize as a foundation for implementing
</text>
<text start="3438.71" dur="2.81">
new systems. So that is also something important to take
</text>
<text start="3441.52" dur="3.849">
into consideration. And here again, if I go to the editing the
</text>
<text start="3445.369" dur="4.391">
styles, I&#39;m just double checking all my descriptions here.
</text>
<text start="3449.76" dur="8.31">
And everything is good to go. Today, we&#39;re going to be talking about product
</text>
<text start="3458.07" dur="4.38">
and system icons and talking about why they&#39;re different.
</text>
<text start="3462.45" dur="4.27">
And the distinctions between them. And we&#39;ll go over also the principles around
</text>
<text start="3466.72" dur="4.79">
how icons are made in material design, just we&#39;re going to briefly go over that.
</text>
<text start="3471.51" dur="5.67">
And then we&#39;re also going to be using a tool that you&#39;ll use throughout the course where
</text>
<text start="3477.18" dur="5.15">
if I go ahead and select on this link here in our exercise file Material Design icons,
</text>
<text start="3482.33" dur="4.81">
I can go ahead and click that checkbox and click on the link.
</text>
<text start="3487.14" dur="4.39">
And you&#39;ll notice that we have this resource for actually accessing these icons.
</text>
<text start="3491.53" dur="7">
So for in this exercise file, I&#39;ve went ahead and imported some but not all of the system
</text>
<text start="3498.53" dur="4.061">
icons in material design. And I did that on purpose, because I want
</text>
<text start="3502.591" dur="4.589">
you to be able to do this yourself. And not only do this yourself, but understand
</text>
<text start="3507.18" dur="8.73">
how to utilize two ways of doing so. So in your exercise files, you&#39;ll have a zip
</text>
<text start="3515.91" dur="6.199">
folder called Material Design icons. And in this folder, there is a set of icons
</text>
<text start="3522.109" dur="6.471">
for Android, for developing for Android. So if you&#39;re designing for Android, you have
</text>
<text start="3528.58" dur="5.69">
these icons here available in their proper format, as you can see in the dot XML file
</text>
<text start="3534.27" dur="5.4">format. And also, we have the font base version of</text>
<text start="3539.67" dur="3.01">
these icons. And then we have the iOS based versions.
</text>
<text start="3542.68" dur="6.86">
And then we also have them exported as PNGs at all sizes, all different sizes and from
</text>
<text start="3549.54" dur="7.75">
18 dips, 2436 and 48 dips at 1x and 2x respective to each size, as you can see there.
</text>
<text start="3557.29" dur="4.64">
And this is very helpful. But also this is a lot of material in this
</text>
<text start="3561.93" dur="5.03">file. So if that seems to be too much for you, you</text>
<text start="3566.96" dur="3.61">can actually go ahead and use this resource here.</text>
<text start="3570.57" dur="6.46">
Again, this resource can be accessed by clicking on this material design icons link in figma.
</text>
<text start="3577.03" dur="5.339">
And opening that and it&#39;ll give you access to this amazing resource that we&#39;ll both be
</text>
<text start="3582.369" dur="5.671">
using as we build out components in this course just in case we&#39;ve missed some icons here
</text>
<text start="3588.04" dur="5.78">
in figma. From my initial export as you can see, I have
</text>
<text start="3593.82" dur="3.56">
these icons categorized visually. And not only that in the Layers panel they
</text>
<text start="3597.38" dur="4.979">
are as they&#39;re exported. These are the The names of each icon, which
</text>
<text start="3602.359" dur="2.871">
is great, so we don&#39;t have to go ahead and label those ourselves.
</text>
<text start="3605.23" dur="5.16">
But we can also tweak the naming later on, if we&#39;d like to.
</text>
<text start="3610.39" dur="4.35">
Maybe we want to get get rid of those underscores. And we&#39;ll get to that when we actually publish
</text>
<text start="3614.74" dur="7.67">
these components to utilize across our designs. And here we have a set of 10 categories, user
</text>
<text start="3622.41" dur="4.52">
actions, icon, font icons, icon specific to devices.
</text>
<text start="3626.93" dur="7">
So here, you can see that that this is definitely heavily used in Android and iOS devices here
</text>
<text start="3633.93" dur="5.4">
indicating the state of batteries, airplane mode, whether it&#39;s on or off, or if you&#39;ve
</text>
<text start="3639.33" dur="5.34">
set alarms, or if your Bluetooth is enabled, connected or disabled, and other things of
</text>
<text start="3644.67" dur="4.8">that nature. And that is this device category.</text>
<text start="3649.47" dur="4.52">
And then we have some other categories, such as some editor icons, which can see commonly
</text>
<text start="3653.99" dur="5.369">
used and other Google products like Google Docs, like some of these are options, when
</text>
<text start="3659.359" dur="5.781">
you select text and edit them in terms of alignment here, some alignment icons and whatnot.
</text>
<text start="3665.14" dur="7.87">
Also some hardware icons, content, icons, file icons, and some other icons such as communication
</text>
<text start="3673.01" dur="4.96">
alert icons. And again, this is only touching on the surface
</text>
<text start="3677.97" dur="5.47">
of icons, because in this tool, there&#39;s an important functionality.
</text>
<text start="3683.44" dur="4.001">
Under this themes category. And top left, you&#39;ll see that there are different
</text>
<text start="3687.441" dur="3.139">
variants of all these icons. So there&#39;s the filled version.
</text>
<text start="3690.58" dur="7.4">
And there&#39;s the outline version there. And you&#39;ll notice that the this filled version,
</text>
<text start="3697.98" dur="6.06">
the is definitely different from the outline version, you can utilize these two versions
</text>
<text start="3704.04" dur="5.01">
of the same icon to indicate state. And there&#39;s also a rounded version of these
</text>
<text start="3709.05" dur="6.19">
icons where the corners are much more rounded, as you can see here, compared to the outlined
</text>
<text start="3715.24" dur="5.879">
variant, elements become more rounded, and smooth, you could say, we also have this two
</text>
<text start="3721.119" dur="6.111">
tone variant, you&#39;ll notice that there&#39;s this second tone of color implemented, that is
</text>
<text start="3727.23" dur="5.34">
a sort of light gray, as the background color on several elements in the interface.
</text>
<text start="3732.57" dur="7.69">
And then we have our sharp variant of icons, where the corners are most definitely very
</text>
<text start="3740.26" dur="6.95">
much sharp on the edges, and whatnot. So with those variants in mind, we can also
</text>
<text start="3747.21" dur="7.149">
toggle the categories specific specifically actions or if I only want alerts to appear,
</text>
<text start="3754.359" dur="4.98">
or only a V icons to appear, or only communication icons to appear.
</text>
<text start="3759.339" dur="4.681">
So basically have the ability to view all of these icons individually or view all of
</text>
<text start="3764.02" dur="5.43">
them at once as there are a ton of icons, I recommend you kind of just skimming through
</text>
<text start="3769.45" dur="4.69">
this understanding what you think you will and won&#39;t use and why not would be a good
</text>
<text start="3774.14" dur="6.709">
test, a meant to your understanding of material design, and the icons needed when we develop
</text>
<text start="3780.849" dur="5.321">
the component library moving forward. And again, if we don&#39;t have these inner figma
</text>
<text start="3786.17" dur="3.97">
file, don&#39;t worry about it. If it&#39;s not here already, we can go ahead
</text>
<text start="3790.14" dur="6.719">
and just create a new category here. And of course, say I don&#39;t have icons in the
</text>
<text start="3796.859" dur="4.721">
from the social category, as there are a lot of social icons, it&#39;s as simple as just clicking
</text>
<text start="3801.58" dur="2.74">
on this icon. And then in the bottom left hand corner in
</text>
<text start="3804.32" dur="3.6">
your browser, you&#39;ll notice that you have the ability to actually export this icon.
</text>
<text start="3807.92" dur="5.541">
And it tells you what size you would be exporting it as and what format so this is the SVG based
</text>
<text start="3813.461" dur="6.648">
format of this icon. And I can also click on that, to open up this,
</text>
<text start="3820.109" dur="3.551">
this panel. And you can either download the SVG format,
</text>
<text start="3823.66" dur="4.64">
or the PNG based format, we&#39;re going to be sticking to the SVG based formats.
</text>
<text start="3828.3" dur="4.87">
And there&#39;s also some instructions on how to style your icons using CSS, it gives you
</text>
<text start="3833.17" dur="5.04">
a little example here. And you can also change the size, which you
</text>
<text start="3838.21" dur="4.45">
download this, SVG will be downloading them in 24 dips.
</text>
<text start="3842.66" dur="5.55">
So and you can also get the black version of the icon or the white version of the icon,
</text>
<text start="3848.21" dur="2.34">
we&#39;re going to stick with the black version of the icon.
</text>
<text start="3850.55" dur="4.96">
As we&#39;ll be designing for light theme in our content, such as typography, and icons will
</text>
<text start="3855.51" dur="5.181">
be dark as opposed to light. And you also can download the iOS based version,
</text>
<text start="3860.691" dur="4.148">
the Android version of this. And again, you have all these icons already
</text>
<text start="3864.839" dur="5.081">
in your your file in your exercise files that you&#39;ve downloaded under, you can get them
</text>
<text start="3869.92" dur="9.37">
under source or whatever device you are designing for you have all of these icons here in all
</text>
<text start="3879.29" dur="5.29">
formats, the outline round sharpen twotone variants and the filled variant as well.
</text>
<text start="3884.58" dur="5.99">
So with that being said, we can go ahead and talk about now that we&#39;ve talked all about
</text>
<text start="3890.57" dur="4.81">
system icons, which is what we just covered, we just covered all the system icons, again,
</text>
<text start="3895.38" dur="4.69">
which is also in this documentation here which will be accessible in the figma file as well.
</text>
<text start="3900.07" dur="2.59">
I&#39;ll make sure that&#39;s in there. So you can click on this link.
</text>
<text start="3902.66" dur="5.73">
So basically, this symbolizes common actions for files, devices and directories.
</text>
<text start="3908.39" dur="6.93">
And the whole concept is to be simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky as each icon
</text>
<text start="3915.32" dur="5.07">
is reduced to its minimal form expressing essential characteristics for the action you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="3920.39" dur="5.17">
trying to take with that design element the icon is associated with.
</text>
<text start="3925.56" dur="6.38">
And you can see, if you were to create your own icons as well, it teaches you how to even
</text>
<text start="3931.94" dur="7.79">
create icons with the proper parameters in regards to the construction of the file, utilizing
</text>
<text start="3939.73" dur="5.99">
the specifications of the grid and key line shapes here, and how to use them on dense
</text>
<text start="3945.72" dur="6.389">
layouts are, and just the layout of the icon itself, which is really interesting.
</text>
<text start="3952.109" dur="9.701">
And also just other specs as well in regards to breaking down what an icon consists of,
</text>
<text start="3961.81" dur="4.33">
and discussing color as well, and the states for an icon.
</text>
<text start="3966.14" dur="6.62">
And we have these icons, states on light backgrounds specified here, which is great, and we can
</text>
<text start="3972.76" dur="6.27">
incorporate that into our system moving forward. And it talks about the variance as well.
</text>
<text start="3979.03" dur="6.559">
The icon themes, which we had went over in the tool here, the themes being filled, outlined,
</text>
<text start="3985.589" dur="4.491">
rounded to tone and sharp. And that is all discussed here in system icons.
</text>
<text start="3990.08" dur="2.769">
And we have now we can also play with them in figma.
</text>
<text start="3992.849" dur="3.381">
If you&#39;d like go ahead and click on them, copy, paste them, throw them into components.
</text>
<text start="3996.23" dur="3.4">
But we&#39;ll do that with much more attention moving forward when we start building out
</text>
<text start="3999.63" dur="3.37">
our component library. And I recommend you going through this and
</text>
<text start="4003" dur="7.119">
reading it taking notes as this will definitely inform you on how to utilize icons in a systematic
</text>
<text start="4010.119" dur="3.711">way. And also just up your game as a designer.</text>
<text start="4013.83" dur="3.93">
So with that being said, we can go ahead and discuss product icons now.
</text>
<text start="4017.76" dur="3.07">So product icons are separate from system icons.</text>
<text start="4020.83" dur="3.91">
Because these are this is the visual expression of a brand&#39;s product and the services and
</text>
<text start="4024.74" dur="3.941">
tools that they offer. So for example, in Google Chrome, if you have
</text>
<text start="4028.681" dur="4.7">
a Google account or Gmail account, you&#39;ll notice that these are product icons, these
</text>
<text start="4033.381" dur="3.959">
aren&#39;t system icons, like like, like in this browser.
</text>
<text start="4037.34" dur="6.32">
These are system icons, which are crafted for common actions and items on an interface.
</text>
<text start="4043.66" dur="6.53">
Whereas these product icons here represent the product itself, the service or the tool.
</text>
<text start="4050.19" dur="4.88">
So that is something important to to note or to apply distinction to.
</text>
<text start="4055.07" dur="7.019">
Because if we go back and talk about the product icons, it talks about how it expresses that
</text>
<text start="4062.089" dur="5.801">
product and how its associated to the company it&#39;s made by so here you can see that being
</text>
<text start="4067.89" dur="6.77">
spoken up here, where the icons in this regard Gmail, Google Calendar, and and a couple other
</text>
<text start="4074.66" dur="5.94">
icons communicate the core idea and intent of a product and they simple, bold and friendly
</text>
<text start="4080.6" dur="4.28">
way, while each icon is still distinct. And all product icons for a brand should be
</text>
<text start="4084.88" dur="5.81">
unified through those concepts and and in its execution.
</text>
<text start="4090.69" dur="7.619">
And here you can see the approach where they actually view their design as material being
</text>
<text start="4098.309" dur="9.33">
a physical quality, such as paper, where, where each piece was cut, folded, and lit.
</text>
<text start="4107.639" dur="6.13">
And that utilizes light as well in association to the icon and represented in this digital
</text>
<text start="4113.769" dur="5.09">
format, to really bring out those surfaces to interact with light.
</text>
<text start="4118.859" dur="5.39">
And you can see the subtle highlights here and the consistent shadowing applied in these
</text>
<text start="4124.249" dur="4.36">
product icons. So if we go ahead and go back to Google&#39;s
</text>
<text start="4128.609" dur="5.55">
suite of product icons here, you can see that in the Gmail icon, and you can see the the
</text>
<text start="4134.159" dur="8.511">
shadows being applied here on these edges, and lighting really being implemented, executed
</text>
<text start="4142.67" dur="4.52">
consistently in all product icons. And you can get specifications on how these
</text>
<text start="4147.19" dur="2.839">
icons are built and whatnot. But this isn&#39;t super specific to what we&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="4150.029" dur="1.94">be doing but I highly recommend you go through it.</text>
<text start="4151.969" dur="4.12">
If you ever want to develop your own icons in the future, this is very helpful talks
</text>
<text start="4156.089" dur="7.43">
about how to treat icons, and how they should be flush with an element surface, etc, etc.
</text>
<text start="4163.519" dur="8.131">
and how to apply proper attention to an icon by not convoluting the icon with excessive
</text>
<text start="4171.65" dur="4.209">
accordion folds. For example in this scenario where you see
</text>
<text start="4175.859" dur="5.081">
these accordion folds or it looks like this papers folding or this icon is folding as
</text>
<text start="4180.94" dur="6.169">
opposed to having too many accordion folds utilize no more than two accordion folds or
</text>
<text start="4187.109" dur="5.2">
just one. Two really provide a clear focal point to
</text>
<text start="4192.309" dur="4.14">
your icon. And of course not distorting or transforming
</text>
<text start="4196.449" dur="3.09">
your icons whether they are product or system icons.
</text>
<text start="4199.539" dur="6.401">
As that is is not an intended approach to designing.
</text>
<text start="4205.94" dur="3.84">
So that is pretty much all I have for you today on product icons.
</text>
<text start="4209.78" dur="6.509">
I recommend you just kind of practicing clicking on one of these, downloading it as an SVG,
</text>
<text start="4216.289" dur="5.191">
and then saving it in a folder somewhere that makes sense for you.
</text>
<text start="4221.48" dur="4.699">
And again, you already have these icons. But I recommend getting into the habit of
</text>
<text start="4226.179" dur="2.731">
this as well, because maybe I&#39;m missing an icon here.
</text>
<text start="4228.91" dur="5.979">
And we can save that SVG, I can go ahead and open up figma and access the Downloads folder,
</text>
<text start="4234.889" dur="5.31">
my finder, and just drag this icon onto the canvas.
</text>
<text start="4240.199" dur="5.951">
And now that I have this icon, which is actually already here, you&#39;ll notice that I have the
</text>
<text start="4246.15" dur="5.13">filled version of this icon, as it states here.</text>
<text start="4251.28" dur="8.589">
So I got the 3d rotation icon at a frame size of 24 by 24, the width and height the set
</text>
<text start="4259.869" dur="5.83">
to 24 dips, or in this case pixels. Or, as thigma calls it points, but not to
</text>
<text start="4265.699" dur="4.951">
confuse you there, just call them dips here, and reference material designs, measurement
</text>
<text start="4270.65" dur="3.389">
terminology. And that is it you just added you can add
</text>
<text start="4274.039" dur="4.341">
it into your library and organize it accordingly. And I will go ahead and continue to build
</text>
<text start="4278.38" dur="4.65">
this library as well as we move forward in this course.
</text>
<text start="4283.03" dur="4.54">
But that is all I have for you when it comes to talking about iconography.
</text>
<text start="4287.57" dur="7.04">
Today, we&#39;re going to be talking about building out the foundation and specifically going
</text>
<text start="4294.61" dur="5.69">
over text legibility and how important that really is to ensure we&#39;re using the proper
</text>
<text start="4300.3" dur="4.98">
color values. So in this tutorial, we&#39;ll be overviewing
</text>
<text start="4305.28" dur="6.78">
the text legibility on material designs website. So here, it discusses the legibility standards.
</text>
<text start="4312.06" dur="5.57">
And in our previous in the previous video, we went over the Leonardo color tool, and
</text>
<text start="4317.63" dur="7.5">
we discussed briefly about the setting contrast ratios, or utilizing this tool to get the
</text>
<text start="4325.13" dur="3.449">
proper contrast ratios. And we&#39;re going to talk about why that&#39;s important
</text>
<text start="4328.579" dur="3.94">
in depth. And here we have some very important article
</text>
<text start="4332.519" dur="4.321">
that I recommend you reading. And this relator article is on material designs
</text>
<text start="4336.84" dur="5.35">
website covering accessibility in general, I highly recommend we, you go through that,
</text>
<text start="4342.19" dur="4.449">
and in its entirety. So here talks about color contrast, can be
</text>
<text start="4346.639" dur="5.011">
used to help users see and interpret apps content and how it&#39;s used heavily across any
</text>
<text start="4351.65" dur="3.339">
and every interface for applications you&#39;ll be building.
</text>
<text start="4354.989" dur="4.351">
And not only the color and contrast, but also talking about the layout and typography as
</text>
<text start="4359.34" dur="1.95">well. I recommend you reading through that on your</text>
<text start="4361.29" dur="5.32">
own. And we&#39;ll be touching on the WCAG standards
</text>
<text start="4366.61" dur="3.949">
and WCAG stands for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
</text>
<text start="4370.559" dur="8.66">
And for those of you who do not know, this requires double a compliance to be ca g double
</text>
<text start="4379.219" dur="8.081">
a compliance for with a ratio 4.5 to one color contrast between text and backgrounds on normal
</text>
<text start="4387.3" dur="7.83">
typography, normal typography being your body copy, such as the body copy in, in this website
</text>
<text start="4395.13" dur="6.619">
that I&#39;m highlighting. And also, a ratio of three to one with utilizing
</text>
<text start="4401.749" dur="5.191">
large texts, a large text could be these headers, ensuring that they have a contrast ratio of
</text>
<text start="4406.94" dur="3.65">
three to one. And here you can see it&#39;s practically black
</text>
<text start="4410.59" dur="5.109">
on a white background. So those contrast ratios will be very, very
</text>
<text start="4415.699" dur="3.811">
strong. And we&#39;ll go ahead and just kind of go through
</text>
<text start="4419.51" dur="4.609">
text on background since that&#39;s basically what our typography will be on.
</text>
<text start="4424.119" dur="5.65">
It&#39;ll be on a background on a variety of components. As you can see here in this image, this text
</text>
<text start="4429.769" dur="6.081">
is on a app bar, and it&#39;s on the app bars background color.
</text>
<text start="4435.85" dur="6.09">
And you&#39;ll notice as well, here we have a notification banner of sorts, where typography
</text>
<text start="4441.94" dur="5.009">
is overlaid on the background color of the notification.
</text>
<text start="4446.949" dur="7.221">
And one thing to cover that is very important is talking about how the text Opacity is applied
</text>
<text start="4454.17" dur="4.759">
in material design as they heavily rely on it to indicate states.
</text>
<text start="4458.929" dur="5.06">
So again, black text is recommended for use on light backgrounds and white text on dark
</text>
<text start="4463.989" dur="3.701">
backgrounds. Which is important to note, especially if
</text>
<text start="4467.69" dur="3.259">
you&#39;re building your app for a light theme or dark theme.
</text>
<text start="4470.949" dur="6.201">
Just make sure that the text is available with proper contrast ratios as stated up here.
</text>
<text start="4477.15" dur="5.6">
And we&#39;re going to go ahead and talk about building some of this out some examples.
</text>
<text start="4482.75" dur="5.989">
And now that we&#39;ve kind of went over using text opacity, or over how it&#39;s used in the
</text>
<text start="4488.739" dur="5.431">
screenshot and how to avoid utilizing it. Here you can see this typography doesn&#39;t change
</text>
<text start="4494.17" dur="5.579">
the opacity of the text is color. But here you can see that the opacity has
</text>
<text start="4499.749" dur="6.271">
been modified, therefore, giving off an opaque gray color, which isn&#39;t legible and very difficult
</text>
<text start="4506.02" dur="4.959">
to see on colored surfaces, as you can see. And next we&#39;ll talk about dark text on light
</text>
<text start="4510.979" dur="3.941">
backgrounds. So material utilizes these principles.
</text>
<text start="4514.92" dur="5.171">
So for the, you could think of this as the active state if you want to, or if you want
</text>
<text start="4520.091" dur="5.289">
to apply a high emphasis on certain information, maybe you want to apply high emphasis on headers,
</text>
<text start="4525.38" dur="6.91">
for example, such as this website, utilize the color black, with an 87% opacity.
</text>
<text start="4532.29" dur="4.92">
And then if you want to apply medium emphasis, which could be medium emphasis, such as typography,
</text>
<text start="4537.21" dur="5.72">
or a default state for, for type higher fee within a component, you utilize the color
</text>
<text start="4542.93" dur="6.189">
black at a 60% opacity. And then the disabled state utilizes an opacity
</text>
<text start="4549.119" dur="7.02">
of 30 38% with the color black. And we&#39;ll go ahead and talk about how to sparsely
</text>
<text start="4556.139" dur="8.33">
use colored texts on top of backgrounds. So colored text typically isn&#39;t used everywhere.
</text>
<text start="4564.469" dur="3.94">
And it&#39;s used selectively to draw attention and apply.
</text>
<text start="4568.409" dur="3.891">
very selective emphasis is ideally color text should be reserved for text elements such
</text>
<text start="4572.3" dur="7.649">
as headlines, buttons, and links. And here you can see cautious usage of, of
</text>
<text start="4579.949" dur="1.79">color. Across the typography.</text>
<text start="4581.739" dur="6.51">
Here you can see yellow and black and this Pink Purple background is just highly not
</text>
<text start="4588.249" dur="2.43">
recommended. I wouldn&#39;t even recommend this, as opposed
</text>
<text start="4590.679" dur="5.231">
to being cautious. Just be aware, if if you&#39;re questioning certain
</text>
<text start="4595.91" dur="6.169">
design elements such as this, it&#39;s better off not utilizing that, and sticking to standards.
</text>
<text start="4602.079" dur="5.87">
And here you can see large headlines and short tech snippets are best for color text.
</text>
<text start="4607.949" dur="3.121">
And next we&#39;ll go ahead and talk about helper text.
</text>
<text start="4611.07" dur="5.22">
And helper text basically gives context about a fields input, such as how the input will
</text>
<text start="4616.29" dur="4.949">
be used, and it can adopt brand colors as well but should be legible.
</text>
<text start="4621.239" dur="6.3">
By all means, according to WCAG standards. And again, it utilizes the same principles.
</text>
<text start="4627.539" dur="7.17">
The only differences helper Tex utilizes a 60% opacity of the color black, and then error
</text>
<text start="4634.709" dur="7.381">
text uses 100% opacity of the color red. And you can see that hex value right there.
</text>
<text start="4642.09" dur="4.58">
So where would you actually see this? Well, you can see this in material designs text
</text>
<text start="4646.67" dur="3.4">
input field. So if we actually go to components here, and
</text>
<text start="4650.07" dur="11.25">
go to whoops, and we search for text input. Let&#39;s see if we can find that text field here
</text>
<text start="4661.32" dur="6.21">
text fields. And we can select the specs, you&#39;ll notice
</text>
<text start="4667.53" dur="6.29">
that there is an error message here for this image for this text input field, which is
</text>
<text start="4673.82" dur="7.46">
utilizing the the error text here this this color property applied to typography to give
</text>
<text start="4681.28" dur="3.25">
context about that fields input, which is right here.
</text>
<text start="4684.53" dur="3.31">
So this was the wrong input by the user in this example, and there&#39;s some error message
</text>
<text start="4687.84" dur="5.53">
that appears. And then in this text field, it has some helper
</text>
<text start="4693.37" dur="3.94">
text that is indicated right there, which is reflected right here.
</text>
<text start="4697.31" dur="7.01">
And this text type this variant of helper text, which is very important.
</text>
<text start="4704.32" dur="8.85">
And we can also discuss selected text next, so selected text can reflect your brand.
</text>
<text start="4713.17" dur="7.299">
And it can utilize an accent of your primary or secondary color in this should be legible
</text>
<text start="4720.469" dur="4.741">
against the selection color and the selection color should contrast the background color.
</text>
<text start="4725.21" dur="5.279">
So that is something important to note here you can see that material designs using the
</text>
<text start="4730.489" dur="6.121">
primary variant color for the highlight for the text selection color, highlighting all
</text>
<text start="4736.61" dur="5.119">
the selected text. And also, another important thing to note
</text>
<text start="4741.729" dur="7.301">
is that icons and other symbols utilize the same principles for for representing icons
</text>
<text start="4749.03" dur="5.27">
and other symbols as typography. And when I say typography, I am referring
</text>
<text start="4754.3" dur="4.899">
to dark texts on light backgrounds and light text on dark backgrounds utilizes the same
</text>
<text start="4759.199" dur="5.28">
principles. And it just adheres to a specific opacity
</text>
<text start="4764.479" dur="3.1">levels. And they are the same opacity levels where</text>
<text start="4767.579" dur="3.35">
they all use the same color black at different levels of opacity.
</text>
<text start="4770.929" dur="5.48">
So the active state is a set to a black of 87% and active is 60%.
</text>
<text start="4776.409" dur="5.621">
And the disabled state is 38%. And one thing you might be asking yourself
</text>
<text start="4782.03" dur="7.149">
as to how do you actually apply this state to your typography.
</text>
<text start="4789.179" dur="3.21">
So one thing we can do is grab these screenshots here.
</text>
<text start="4792.389" dur="5.84">
So I can grab a screenshot of this and then go ahead and open up our exercise file.
</text>
<text start="4798.229" dur="9.24">
Text legibility sudden they&#39;re gonna go ahead and also reference the text types here.
</text>
<text start="4807.469" dur="8.72">
And basically with all of these screenshots, we&#39;re going to be justifying how many types
</text>
<text start="4816.189" dur="6.591">
of color styles we&#39;ll need to provide the proper emphasis in components as we create
</text>
<text start="4822.78" dur="6.989">
them, and then build them out as color styles, which will then publish later to reuse.
</text>
<text start="4829.769" dur="8.261">
so here we can see, I said iterator before. Both icons and symbols have the same principles
</text>
<text start="4838.03" dur="4.319">
for dark text on light backgrounds and light texts on dark backgrounds.
</text>
<text start="4842.349" dur="3.691">
It&#39;s uses the same principles and levels of opacity.
</text>
<text start="4846.04" dur="5.01">
So, meaning we only need to actually create three styles here.
</text>
<text start="4851.05" dur="7.719">
It&#39;s the active, inactive and disabled for icons and symbols, excuse me.
</text>
<text start="4858.769" dur="8.281">
Also, just providing the high emphasis, medium emphasis and disabled state for dark text
</text>
<text start="4867.05" dur="4.859">
on light background. So what we can do is let this all live under
</text>
<text start="4871.909" dur="13.44">
a content section of color styles as well. So we can go ahead and define that as extend
</text>
<text start="4885.349" dur="4.69">
iconography. So that is basically what is covered in all
</text>
<text start="4890.039" dur="6.721">
three of these screenshots. So what we can do is just create a textile.
</text>
<text start="4896.76" dur="2.851">
So we can start off with this screenshot, I&#39;m gonna move these out of the ways, so I
</text>
<text start="4899.611" dur="4.468">
don&#39;t confuse any of you. Since there&#39;s a lot of information in that
</text>
<text start="4904.079" dur="6.801">
area, I&#39;m actually just going to grab a textile and material design just uses Roboto.
</text>
<text start="4910.88" dur="9.58">
It doesn&#39;t matter what the type settings are. I&#39;m just going to change that up real quick.
</text>
<text start="4920.46" dur="8.009">And and now, all we&#39;re going to want to do is</text>
<text start="4928.469" dur="4.09">
define the color. And this active state is set to 87%.
</text>
<text start="4932.559" dur="3.89">
Currently, the color is set to 100. So I&#39;m just going to change that input field,
</text>
<text start="4936.449" dur="6.311">
what we can do is just select that style icon. And you&#39;ll notice that we can go ahead and
</text>
<text start="4942.76" dur="8.35">
click on Create style. And then I&#39;m going to type in text, and iconography.
</text>
<text start="4951.11" dur="5.879">
And this is going to be this naming convention is going to be the header.
</text>
<text start="4956.989" dur="4.271">So we know how to utilize that in the color panel.</text>
<text start="4961.26" dur="4.14">
So I&#39;m going to just select active active here.
</text>
<text start="4965.4" dur="9.069">
And then you can also specify the percentage if you want designers to be able to read that
</text>
<text start="4974.469" dur="4.451">
right off the bat as they&#39;re looking at the name of the color style, or you can remove
</text>
<text start="4978.92" dur="5.84">
it, I&#39;m just going to remove it and select Create style, I&#39;ve now created that text style,
</text>
<text start="4984.76" dur="6.509">
which is exactly what I want for any active icons or other symbols.
</text>
<text start="4991.269" dur="4.02">
And then we&#39;re going to go ahead and duplicate this.
</text>
<text start="4995.289" dur="3.971">
And once that is duplicated, I&#39;m going to detach the style.
</text>
<text start="4999.26" dur="2.299">
And just specify the inactive state, which is very simple.
</text>
<text start="5001.559" dur="3.5">
All we have to do is change the path city once more to 60%.
</text>
<text start="5005.059" dur="4.71">
And that represents the inactive state of any icons or other symbols.
</text>
<text start="5009.769" dur="3.401">
And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and create another style.
</text>
<text start="5013.17" dur="9.12">
And again, I just labeled that text and iconography, the category uses flash naming convention.
</text>
<text start="5022.29" dur="10.639">
And now I am going to specify inactive. And then we can also specify that this inactive
</text>
<text start="5032.929" dur="6.52">
state is if I click on this edit style icon, I can add a description and go ahead and state
</text>
<text start="5039.449" dur="9.641">
that utilized for icons and other symbols as specified here.
</text>
<text start="5049.09" dur="3.509">
In case designers want to know what that color style is for if they&#39;re not sure how to use
</text>
<text start="5052.599" dur="1.54">it. That is very important.</text>
<text start="5054.139" dur="5.25">
You can go ahead and modify those properties as well later on down the road as well.
</text>
<text start="5059.389" dur="5.651">
I&#39;m going to go ahead and duplicate this and detach the style and set this to the opacity
</text>
<text start="5065.04" dur="4.519">of 38%. And we now have the disabled state for our</text>
<text start="5069.559" dur="5.611">
not only icons and other symbols, but we have the disabled state for our typography as well.
</text>
<text start="5075.17" dur="7.599">
So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and click style icon again, create that style, and label it text
</text>
<text start="5082.769" dur="5.421">
and iconography. And now that we have that, we can go ahead
</text>
<text start="5088.19" dur="5.32">
and label this disabled. And now we have our three color styles.
</text>
<text start="5093.51" dur="4.669">
If I go ahead and select some text again, and I go to my color styles, you&#39;ll notice
</text>
<text start="5098.179" dur="7.06">
that I have the text and iconography section and hear it not only gives me the name of
</text>
<text start="5105.239" dur="3.121">
that color style, but it&#39;ll also give me the description if there is a description, as
</text>
<text start="5108.36" dur="4.15">
you can see here in the tooltip, as you hover over the color style, so you can understand
</text>
<text start="5112.51" dur="4.419">
what the uses usage is, or description is for that color style.
</text>
<text start="5116.929" dur="6.891">
So that is awesome. And now, now that we have this active state
</text>
<text start="5123.82" dur="8.81">
here, it could be a matter of, we could do a various, there are various decisions you
</text>
<text start="5132.63" dur="3.359">
can make with your team as you&#39;re building out your design system as nomenclature is
</text>
<text start="5135.989" dur="4.761">
extremely important when you start implementing these foundational elements in your design
</text>
<text start="5140.75" dur="3.229">system. So one question that I am posing, and that</text>
<text start="5143.979" dur="5.68">
you might be asking yourself as well right now is that if these are the same values,
</text>
<text start="5149.659" dur="6.36">
same hex values, same opacity, and for everything, here are dark text on light backgrounds and
</text>
<text start="5156.019" dur="7.71">
icons and other symbols, should I recreate other styles? Well, the answer is no, you
</text>
<text start="5163.729" dur="11.01">
don&#39;t have to, what you could do is go ahead, edit this and specify that this in the description,
</text>
<text start="5174.739" dur="4.53">
you could specify that this is also high emphasis, right.
</text>
<text start="5179.269" dur="8.52">
So you could specify that that is high emphasis for for dark text on light backgrounds.
</text>
<text start="5187.789" dur="8.841">
Or, better yet, what we can do is, instead of having users go to the description of the
</text>
<text start="5196.63" dur="4.199">
color style to identify exactly what the usage is, for this color style, I&#39;m going to go
</text>
<text start="5200.829" dur="6.16">
ahead and just modify the name of this. So what I&#39;m going to do is specify that this
</text>
<text start="5206.989" dur="9.65">
is high emphasis. And I&#39;m going to go ahead and put in parentheses,
</text>
<text start="5216.639" dur="5.281">the active state, or you could do it vice versa.</text>
<text start="5221.92" dur="5.19">
And then I&#39;m just going to save that, now that has been saved, that is high emphasis,
</text>
<text start="5227.11" dur="6.529">
I&#39;m going to go ahead and select the inactive state and ensure that I edit the name as well.
</text>
<text start="5233.639" dur="8.1">
And then specify medium emphasis. And once I have specified that, I will save
</text>
<text start="5241.739" dur="4.34">
that. And now I&#39;m going to go ahead and select this,
</text>
<text start="5246.079" dur="3.06">
and disabled is just disabled. So that is fantastic.
</text>
<text start="5249.139" dur="3.781">
We don&#39;t actually have to rename that. And these are important decisions to make
</text>
<text start="5252.92" dur="6.98">
and to understand, as you can see that quickly a design system could be very polluted in
</text>
<text start="5259.9" dur="5.509">
terms of how you name things, not only in your design system or designs, but also in
</text>
<text start="5265.409" dur="4.471">
development, it&#39;s very important to really sync with your engineers and understand what
</text>
<text start="5269.88" dur="6.87">
they&#39;ve implemented in their in their color palette, or that wherever that that CSS file
</text>
<text start="5276.75" dur="5.03">
is that sass less file, wherever that color palette is in react for examples, that&#39;s a
</text>
<text start="5281.78" dur="4.949">
very popular framework right now, really trying to understand where those hex values lie.
</text>
<text start="5286.729" dur="2.571">If they even are hex values or the RGBA. Base.</text>
<text start="5289.3" dur="4.75">
These are very important questions to ask your developers if you haven&#39;t already, and
</text>
<text start="5294.05" dur="5.52">
to really start aligning your system with what is currently in development to really
</text>
<text start="5299.57" dur="6.34">
enhance the workflow amongst designers and engineers and really start to solidify and
</text>
<text start="5305.91" dur="3.74">
create a unified language across design and engineering.
</text>
<text start="5309.65" dur="6.239">
So that is all for the dark text on light backgrounds and icons and other symbols.
</text>
<text start="5315.889" dur="4.801">
Next, we&#39;re going to go ahead and talk about the the text types.
</text>
<text start="5320.69" dur="6.099">
So one thing we did miss is that we&#39;ve labeled this medium emphasis and inactive for that
</text>
<text start="5326.789" dur="5.821">
for this state here, medium emphasis. And inactive, we can also specify in the scription
</text>
<text start="5332.61" dur="8.77">
that this is utilized for helper text. So I can go ahead and specify that there.
</text>
<text start="5341.38" dur="5.929">
And that solves my problem. And then we can the last text color style
</text>
<text start="5347.309" dur="5.881">
we need is the error text. So we need to go ahead and duplicate this.
</text>
<text start="5353.19" dur="4.449">Detach the style, set the opacity back to 100%.</text>
<text start="5357.639" dur="6.951">
And then go ahead and set that color to red. And now that we have the color set to read,
</text>
<text start="5364.59" dur="3.339">
we are good to go. All we have to do is click on the style icon
</text>
<text start="5367.929" dur="5.941">
Click Create style, and then ensure that it is under the same category as the rest of
</text>
<text start="5373.87" dur="5.74">
the color styles and type in air, text and create style.
</text>
<text start="5379.61" dur="4.42">
And we are rocking and rolling folks, we have created all the color styles that we&#39;ll need
</text>
<text start="5384.03" dur="4.3">
to utilize as we continue to build out the foundation of our material design system.
</text>
<text start="5388.33" dur="5.059">
So if we go ahead and check these color styles out locally, and say I pull out like a rectangle,
</text>
<text start="5393.389" dur="4.911">
and go and look at my color palette. It all lives under text and iconography and
</text>
<text start="5398.3" dur="5.37">
my color Styles panel And drag that over. And you can see that now I have this text,
</text>
<text start="5403.67" dur="4.15">
high emphasis, color style, the medium emphasis, which is also the inactive state.
</text>
<text start="5407.82" dur="5.109">
We also have the high emphasis, which is the active state for icons and symbols and high
</text>
<text start="5412.929" dur="3.61">
emphasis pertaining to the dark text on light backgrounds.
</text>
<text start="5416.539" dur="3.801">
So we&#39;re ensuring that all of this content is reused and simplified.
</text>
<text start="5420.34" dur="6.819">
So there&#39;s no duplication of color styles, which is not necessary, nor Is that necessary
</text>
<text start="5427.159" dur="6.351">
in development either, if you can solidify that and simplify it, and we have our error
</text>
<text start="5433.51" dur="5.149">
text as well, and our disabled text, which is all covered here, and that is all I have
</text>
<text start="5438.659" dur="6.63">
for you in the text legibility. And I do recommend that you go over the web
</text>
<text start="5445.289" dur="4.93">
content accessibility guidelines to really just understand this, I know a lot of information.
</text>
<text start="5450.219" dur="4.841">
But the more you read this and take notes on it, the more it&#39;ll pay off and give you
</text>
<text start="5455.06" dur="4.92">
an edge as a designer, as accessibility is extremely important.
</text>
<text start="5459.98" dur="7.8">
We&#39;re going to be covering States under the interaction portion of this section in the
</text>
<text start="5467.78" dur="3.14">
foundation. As we continue to build our foundation, we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="5470.92" dur="3.88">
going to go over viewing states, if you go ahead and click on this link in this exercise
</text>
<text start="5474.8" dur="4.7">
file to open up a link and give you access to these states here.
</text>
<text start="5479.5" dur="6.76">
And once you have that page visible, you can see that states are visual representations
</text>
<text start="5486.26" dur="4.39">
used to communicate the status of a component or an interactive element.
</text>
<text start="5490.65" dur="6.11">
And we&#39;re going to be covering the we&#39;re going to overview of the contents within this page
</text>
<text start="5496.76" dur="5.379">
and how that translates into figma. That is translated here.
</text>
<text start="5502.139" dur="5.811">
And then we&#39;re going to cover the usage of states and when to apply them, get an understanding
</text>
<text start="5507.95" dur="2.95">
of that. And we&#39;re going to go over all the type of
</text>
<text start="5510.9" dur="3.65">
states as well. And then we&#39;re going to break down the anatomy
</text>
<text start="5514.55" dur="6.989">
of a state and understand the usage and some foundational guidelines to follow along.
</text>
<text start="5521.539" dur="6.14">
And also, again, implementing states and figma, and how they&#39;re utilized as color styles or
</text>
<text start="5527.679" dur="4.321">
Yes, color styles in figma. And I&#39;ll go over in these examples I&#39;ve created
</text>
<text start="5532" dur="3.749">
for you how to implement them. And we&#39;ll go ahead and build those a few of
</text>
<text start="5535.749" dur="3.881">
those out as well. And without any further ado, let&#39;s get started
</text>
<text start="5539.63" dur="6.06">
on the usage of states. So states communicate the status of UI elements.
</text>
<text start="5545.69" dur="5.15">
Here, you can see a hover state on this component, which is a row of tabs.
</text>
<text start="5550.84" dur="5.149">
Here, you can see the pressed state on a button here.
</text>
<text start="5555.989" dur="3.371">
And here you can see the drag state of a chip component.
</text>
<text start="5559.36" dur="2.04">And here you can see the focus state of a button.</text>
<text start="5561.4" dur="3.599">
And here you can see the selected state of a line item.
</text>
<text start="5564.999" dur="2.41">
And there are other states, of course here as well.
</text>
<text start="5567.409" dur="3.351">
And again, this communicates status UI elements to the user.
</text>
<text start="5570.76" dur="5.601">
And each status state should be visually similar and not drastically alter a component, but
</text>
<text start="5576.361" dur="5.709">
must have clear affordances that distinguish it from other states and the surrounding layout.
</text>
<text start="5582.07" dur="7.649">
So with that in mind with to accomplish that the material design adheres to these three
</text>
<text start="5589.719" dur="7.63">
principles distinction, ensuring that these states are have an additive principle to it,
</text>
<text start="5597.349" dur="3.59">
where states occur at once, such as selection and hover.
</text>
<text start="5600.939" dur="6.49">
And both state indicators are displayed when taking those actions, whether it&#39;s a selection
</text>
<text start="5607.429" dur="3.79">
or hover. And of course, consistency is another principle
</text>
<text start="5611.219" dur="5.811">
where states should be applied consistently across components in order to increase usability.
</text>
<text start="5617.03" dur="5.28">
And of course, they states are distinct, or they have clear affordances, distinguishing
</text>
<text start="5622.31" dur="5.03">
them from one another. In regards to the surrounding UI, it is associated
</text>
<text start="5627.34" dur="6.58">
with emphasizing according to their level, their priority levels.
</text>
<text start="5633.92" dur="3.71">
And now we&#39;re going to cover all the these type of states.
</text>
<text start="5637.63" dur="2.52">
So here you can see that there is an enabled state.
</text>
<text start="5640.15" dur="5.869">
And it&#39;s utilizing a button example for the first four states where an enabled state communicates
</text>
<text start="5646.019" dur="4.56">
an interactive component or element. So essentially, an enabled state is just the
</text>
<text start="5650.579" dur="6.14">
default state of a component. So you can think of enabled as default.
</text>
<text start="5656.719" dur="3.431">
Just communicate stuff, this is a button that you can click.
</text>
<text start="5660.15" dur="6.21">
And the disabled here is a disabled state of a button, which just states that a it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="5666.36" dur="6.1">
a non interactive component or element, so you can&#39;t actually click on it as it is disabled.
</text>
<text start="5672.46" dur="8.269">
And here, we have a hover state for a button. And that communicates when a user has placed
</text>
<text start="5680.729" dur="5.98">
a cursor above an interactive element. And we also have a focus state where it communicates
</text>
<text start="5686.709" dur="5.651">
when a user has highlighted an element using an input method such as a keyboard or voice.
</text>
<text start="5692.36" dur="4.25">
So if I hit tab, you&#39;ll notice that I can tab through this interface here.
</text>
<text start="5696.61" dur="5.589">
I&#39;m tabbing to this this anchor link and I&#39;m tabbing To this button here, that is the focus
</text>
<text start="5702.199" dur="4.841">
state on this button. So that is an example of that.
</text>
<text start="5707.04" dur="8.209">
If we go back here to the type of states whoops, one second.
</text>
<text start="5715.249" dur="6.06">
So if we go back to these type of states, here, we have the selected state, which communicates
</text>
<text start="5721.309" dur="6.231">
a user&#39;s choice where they selected a, a line item, or you call that a list item as well.
</text>
<text start="5727.54" dur="6.51">
And here, we have an activated state, which communicates a highlight a destination, whether
</text>
<text start="5734.05" dur="5.47">
initiated by the user or by default. And here we have a press state which communicates
</text>
<text start="5739.52" dur="3.599">
a user&#39;s tap. And you can see a ripple effect, which is
</text>
<text start="5743.119" dur="6.32">
what that circle is called a ripple, which is created when you use when you press a button
</text>
<text start="5749.439" dur="4.01">
or an element. And a press state, it just communicates a
</text>
<text start="5753.449" dur="5.431">
user&#39;s click or tap. And here we have a drag state, which communicates
</text>
<text start="5758.88" dur="7.779">
when a user presses and moves in element. And we also have the on state, which is typically
</text>
<text start="5766.659" dur="8.51">
used for buttons, checkboxes, and radios, or switches, radios and checkboxes, excuse
</text>
<text start="5775.169" dur="2.37">
me. And that on state communicates a toggle between
</text>
<text start="5777.539" dur="4.401">
two options, which is and the two options are on and off.
</text>
<text start="5781.94" dur="4.929">
And off is the other state, which just communicate to toggle between two options here, you can
</text>
<text start="5786.869" dur="5.62">
see that the off state is indicated in the switch, radio and checkbox component.
</text>
<text start="5792.489" dur="5.971">
And also, we have error states. And the air state communicates a user or system
</text>
<text start="5798.46" dur="3.909">
mistake, as you can see, which is indicated with the color red.
</text>
<text start="5802.369" dur="5.971">
And the label in this icon, this informative icon and the red underline of this text input
</text>
<text start="5808.34" dur="6.52">
field and also some helper texts to indicate the air whether a user created made the air
</text>
<text start="5814.86" dur="6.099">
or the system had created a mistake. So how are these states communicated? That
</text>
<text start="5820.959" dur="2.921">
is an important question. Now that we&#39;ve went over all the type of states,
</text>
<text start="5823.88" dur="5.489">
we&#39;re going to break down the anatomy. So states in figma, are communicated through
</text>
<text start="5829.369" dur="3.911">an overlay. So you can see these states here.</text>
<text start="5833.28" dur="9.14">
And in this section, it represents states for content on the surface on surface color.
</text>
<text start="5842.42" dur="7.969">
And also states inherited from content. And it&#39;s essentially an overlay is just a
</text>
<text start="5850.389" dur="4.15">
semi transparent covering on an element that indicates its state.
</text>
<text start="5854.539" dur="4.48">
And the overlays provide a systematic approach to visualizing states by using opacity.
</text>
<text start="5859.019" dur="4.29">
So here, you can see that this state utilizes a black overlay.
</text>
<text start="5863.309" dur="6.591">
And this is the focus state. And it gives you the the overlays, percentage
</text>
<text start="5869.9" dur="10.349">
base value, the opacity, and it uses the color black here for this focus state overlay for
</text>
<text start="5880.249" dur="6.54">
content on the surface. And the structure of the overlay lives right
</text>
<text start="5886.789" dur="3.88">
in between the container, which you could just think of as the surface.
</text>
<text start="5890.669" dur="3.671">
So this is the surface here. And then the overlay lives right in between
</text>
<text start="5894.34" dur="3.839">
the content and the container. So it starts off with the content being on
</text>
<text start="5898.179" dur="4.51">
top, and then the overlay, which is where the state is represented, which is right in
</text>
<text start="5902.689" dur="3.12">
the middle. And then at the very bottom is the container
</text>
<text start="5905.809" dur="4.13">in which both the Overlay and content lie upon.</text>
<text start="5909.939" dur="4.22">
So that is important to note. And that that same structure in this diagram
</text>
<text start="5914.159" dur="6.491">
is applied throughout the rest of these containers. Here you can see the surface container states,
</text>
<text start="5920.65" dur="5.6">
whether it&#39;s on primary content, what that state would look like, and what that state
</text>
<text start="5926.25" dur="4.01">
looks like inherited from content, and then the surface itself and what that state would
</text>
<text start="5930.26" dur="5.08">
look like when it&#39;s selected. And you&#39;ll notice that in the disabled state.
</text>
<text start="5935.34" dur="6.639">
Despite the surface container, whether it&#39;s on the primary surface, or on the generic
</text>
<text start="5941.979" dur="8.44">
surface, the white surface, you&#39;ll notice that the content, the content being the typography
</text>
<text start="5950.419" dur="4.83">
is the state that is actually manipulated, not the backgrounds itself in the disabled
</text>
<text start="5955.249" dur="6.18">
state. So in for that, that text is set to disabled.
</text>
<text start="5961.429" dur="5.36">
And again, just to continue to break down the anatomy of the overlay which represents
</text>
<text start="5966.789" dur="5.241">
the state in our designs. It it provides a systematic approach to visualizing
</text>
<text start="5972.03" dur="5.66">
states by using opacity and can be applied to an entire element or in a circular shape.
</text>
<text start="5977.69" dur="6.06">
As you can see here, it&#39;s applied in the circular shape the state when being pressed, and the
</text>
<text start="5983.75" dur="4.92">
overlay color matches the color of the text or icon on the element that it&#39;s applied to.
</text>
<text start="5988.67" dur="7.59">
So here you can see in the third example that the radio list that is selected is utilizing
</text>
<text start="5996.26" dur="5.621">
the primary color which is set to a blue purple and then The state associated with it is a
</text>
<text start="6001.881" dur="5.649">
no uses the same color, but an opaque opaque value of that color.
</text>
<text start="6007.53" dur="8.819">
And as you can see that here as well in figma, where the state layer uses the primary overlay
</text>
<text start="6016.349" dur="6.5">
the primary color as an overlay, and uses different opacities to indicate the hovered
</text>
<text start="6022.849" dur="6.21">
focused press dragged and selected states of that color.
</text>
<text start="6029.059" dur="8.231">
And you can see that the depending on the type of component and state, so in this line
</text>
<text start="6037.29" dur="5.44">
item, the selected checkbox is using the primary color.
</text>
<text start="6042.73" dur="6.209">
And you&#39;ll notice that the selected state of this line item also uses that color, but
</text>
<text start="6048.939" dur="4.341">
an opaque value of that color. So that is important to know.
</text>
<text start="6053.28" dur="4.97">
And you&#39;ll notice the same exact thing in this checkbox, where this is using the the
</text>
<text start="6058.25" dur="3.77">
outline of the checkbox itself and the enabled state is set to black.
</text>
<text start="6062.02" dur="6.99">
And then the hover state of that checkbox uses an opaque value of black.
</text>
<text start="6069.01" dur="6.83">
And you can see that here in figma, where on hover that uses an overlay of 4%, which
</text>
<text start="6075.84" dur="7.239">
is just a black overlay on hover, which is what we&#39;re seeing here in this checkbox.
</text>
<text start="6083.079" dur="5.38">
Which is very important to note, and only one state layer is applied at a time.
</text>
<text start="6088.459" dur="4.521">
As you can see here, for example, if an element is first focus and then hovered, the hover
</text>
<text start="6092.98" dur="5.449">
state layer will be shown only until the hover is complete, then returning to the focus state
</text>
<text start="6098.429" dur="5.19">
layer if the element is still focused, so you can&#39;t do two things at once or two states
</text>
<text start="6103.619" dur="5.29">
at once. And with that being said, there are also overlay
</text>
<text start="6108.909" dur="6.681">
opacity values applied here, which we can implement ourselves in figma.
</text>
<text start="6115.59" dur="9.129">
So I could even redo the surfaces, go to figma paste the screenshot.
</text>
<text start="6124.719" dur="6.28">
And with the screenshot, I can actually recreate the states as layers here, I can go ahead
</text>
<text start="6130.999" dur="8.571">
and create a rectangle for example. And I know that the hover state is utilizing
</text>
<text start="6139.57" dur="7.109">
a the the color black set to 4% opacity, so I can go ahead and apply the color black,
</text>
<text start="6146.679" dur="5.891">
which is a hex value of 0000, set the opacity of 4%.
</text>
<text start="6152.57" dur="10.77">
I can then turn this into a frame and label this the hover state the on surface hover
</text>
<text start="6163.34" dur="5.819">state. And that rectangle represents exactly that.</text>
<text start="6169.159" dur="5.641">
Maybe I can ungroup that frame actually and apply that name to the rectangle itself, we
</text>
<text start="6174.8" dur="9.259">
have that we can add some text here, just type in hover, go ahead and increase the size
</text>
<text start="6184.059" dur="9.341">of that. And once that is all done, I can go ahead</text>
<text start="6193.4" dur="9.409">
and actually just group that into a frame. Again, vertically align this text and go ahead
</text>
<text start="6202.809" dur="10.191">
and specify the opacity and I could specify the hex value as well, just so no one gets
</text>
<text start="6213" dur="4.189">
confused. So users will know that this is an overlay
</text>
<text start="6217.189" dur="4.95">
state hover state, but what is the actual color first, designers would actually have
</text>
<text start="6222.139" dur="7.48">
to click on the the rectangle shape to understand the hex value and the Opacity applied to it.
</text>
<text start="6229.619" dur="9.701">
Or we could specify it here. And just have it labeled as such, if you&#39;d
</text>
<text start="6239.32" dur="1.94">
like. And I&#39;m going to go ahead and stretch this
</text>
<text start="6241.26" dur="4.89">out. So that is a good example.</text>
<text start="6246.15" dur="4.4">
Here. That is one example of how you could indicate
</text>
<text start="6250.55" dur="7.7">
your states, I can go ahead and even duplicate this, change that to the focus state and then
</text>
<text start="6258.25" dur="6.699">
add the 12% Overlay and utilizes the same color of black again.
</text>
<text start="6264.949" dur="8.69">
And then there&#39;s a selected state. So I can even do the selected state where
</text>
<text start="6273.639" dur="7.091">
the utilizes the on primary color value, the primary color value, but I&#39;m gonna detach
</text>
<text start="6280.73" dur="5.38">
this style. And it only uses 8% opacity of the primary
</text>
<text start="6286.11" dur="5.129">
color value as you can see there. And I might, I&#39;m going to want to copy that.
</text>
<text start="6291.239" dur="5.851">
Paste that hex value in right here. And you&#39;ll start to see that we&#39;re specifying
</text>
<text start="6297.09" dur="6.649">
the states here in our system, which is Fantastic. And then we can go ahead and do the same thing
</text>
<text start="6303.739" dur="6.811">
for the activated state. So you&#39;re starting to see how we create exactly
</text>
<text start="6310.55" dur="7.12">
our states for our components here in figma, which is great.
</text>
<text start="6317.67" dur="4.9">
No, getting you into the habit. So the activated state, I can go ahead and
</text>
<text start="6322.57" dur="5.609">change the opacity to 12%, slightly darker shade.</text>
<text start="6328.179" dur="4.42">
And I can even go ahead and represent the press state, which is actually a ripple effect.
</text>
<text start="6332.599" dur="3.89">
So what we can do for the ripple effect is just create a circle.
</text>
<text start="6336.489" dur="10.531">
So on the prostate, the color is just set to, to white at 100% opacity.
</text>
<text start="6347.02" dur="8.139">
But the, we&#39;re going to use the, we&#39;re going to create a circle here, and ellipse to represent,
</text>
<text start="6355.159" dur="6.56">
I&#39;m going to put that behind the typography here and ensure that lives in this layer,
</text>
<text start="6361.719" dur="7.02">
I&#39;m going to clip the content so that the circle doesn&#39;t go outside of the frames bounds.
</text>
<text start="6368.739" dur="10.332">
It&#39;s hidden, if it exceeds the frames bounds. And with that circle, I&#39;m going to just go
</text>
<text start="6379.071" dur="9.189">
ahead and change that color to black, and then set the opacity to 12%.
</text>
<text start="6388.26" dur="5.949">
And here we have our pressed state, which is awesome.
</text>
<text start="6394.209" dur="10.72">
And then we can even do a drag to state where the drag state utilizes an 8% overlay.
</text>
<text start="6404.929" dur="5.281">
Whereas the focus and hover states have different hover, use a 4% overlay in the focus, use
</text>
<text start="6410.21" dur="4.11">
a 12% overlay. I&#39;m going to go ahead and create that dragged
</text>
<text start="6414.32" dur="7.919">
overlay, change the opacity to 8%. Hit Enter and is now a darker shade.
</text>
<text start="6422.239" dur="3.99">
And I&#39;m just going to specify that make sure it&#39;s accurate in the text here.
</text>
<text start="6426.229" dur="5.23">
And I&#39;ve now created all my states. And the next thing you&#39;ll want to do is actually
</text>
<text start="6431.459" dur="5.18">
command clicks to deep select and select the triangle with the actual state you&#39;re trying
</text>
<text start="6436.639" dur="4.031">
to create. You can go to the style icon and click Create
</text>
<text start="6440.67" dur="3.739">
style. And what you would want to do is ensure that
</text>
<text start="6444.409" dur="5.59">
you&#39;re properly labeling these. And you can either check this documentation
</text>
<text start="6449.999" dur="5.731">
ensure that you&#39;re creating the right state. Or you can reference how I&#39;ve already built
</text>
<text start="6455.73" dur="3.78">
out all of these states. So you&#39;ll notice it starts with states.
</text>
<text start="6459.51" dur="4.279">
And then it uses the slash naming convention to categorize these states accordingly.
</text>
<text start="6463.789" dur="4.46">
And it has the these black states labeled as black overlay.
</text>
<text start="6468.249" dur="4.81">
And then it has these primary states which are purple, labeled as primary overlays.
</text>
<text start="6473.059" dur="8.18">
And then we have the white overlays for when you&#39;re using when you&#39;re creating states on
</text>
<text start="6481.239" dur="5.121">
top of pri on primary content, which utilizes the purple background.
</text>
<text start="6486.36" dur="5.04">
So that is important to note, which is where these white overlay states are utilized.
</text>
<text start="6491.4" dur="4.61">
And I recommend you going ahead and building up the rest of these states in exercise, I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="6496.01" dur="3.08">going to pause this video and create them myself.</text>
<text start="6499.09" dur="3.259">
And I challenge you to create them for yourself as well.
</text>
<text start="6502.349" dur="3.281">
Note that I am missing the enabled state. So go ahead and add that enabled state here
</text>
<text start="6505.63" dur="4.37">
for this one. And then for the on primary as well for this
</text>
<text start="6510" dur="3.78">
section, creating those as well. And pause this video and I&#39;m going to create
</text>
<text start="6513.78" dur="7.23">
them and I&#39;ll see you when I&#39;m done. So now I that I created all these states for
</text>
<text start="6521.01" dur="6.57">
when you&#39;re on when your content is on the on primary surface utilizing this color here
</text>
<text start="6527.58" dur="7.519">
of 62 double zero double e x phi, which is just like this purple variant as color of
</text>
<text start="6535.099" dur="4.61">
purple. And anyways, point being is that you&#39;ll notice
</text>
<text start="6539.709" dur="3.751">
what I what I ended up doing. If you achieve a similar result actually end
</text>
<text start="6543.46" dur="5.929">
up copying all these and then pasting them right over here, I added a background to represent
</text>
<text start="6549.389" dur="7.661">
what that looks like on the on primary surface. And once I did that, all I had to do was actually
</text>
<text start="6557.05" dur="4.879">
change these values to white and you&#39;ll notice a couple things that are are different in
</text>
<text start="6561.929" dur="4.831">
the system when it comes to utilizing the opacity for states on the on primary surface
</text>
<text start="6566.76" dur="5.759">
as opposed to the on a surface, which is just a white background on surface being the white
</text>
<text start="6572.519" dur="6.151">
background on primary using this purple color that the opacities are much stronger when
</text>
<text start="6578.67" dur="6.679">
it comes to the activated state in the on primary states for activated impressed and
</text>
<text start="6585.349" dur="6.21">
also the drag state you&#39;ll notice that there I&#39;ve doubled here and the drag state from
</text>
<text start="6591.559" dur="7.39">
8% opacity to 16 utilizing a white color overlay as opposed to a black one and is set to 32%
</text>
<text start="6598.949" dur="5.82">
here And 24% there, which is something important to note.
</text>
<text start="6604.769" dur="6.46">
And that is pretty much it, I ended up creating these this color styles here, I challenge
</text>
<text start="6611.229" dur="5.792">
you to create those color styles by selecting these rectangles and clicking on style, create
</text>
<text start="6617.021" dur="2.609">
style. And then the naming convention, you&#39;ll use
</text>
<text start="6619.63" dur="5.769">
a state&#39;s and then space slash space. And then this is a white overlay.
</text>
<text start="6625.399" dur="4.52">
And the the type of white overlay it is as the focus state.
</text>
<text start="6629.919" dur="4.861">
So I could just hit focus, hit Create style, and I&#39;ve created the focus state style, I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="6634.78" dur="5.149">
actually going to right click and delete that style from my local styles, which will appear
</text>
<text start="6639.929" dur="2.13">
at the very bottom since it&#39;s a new style created.
</text>
<text start="6642.059" dur="3.171">
And that appears in that order from based on when it was created.
</text>
<text start="6645.23" dur="2.21">
Right click and delete it, since I already have it.
</text>
<text start="6647.44" dur="4.199">
And again, you have these styles to reference I recommend you going in and making these
</text>
<text start="6651.639" dur="6.67">
and then creating them as needed. We&#39;re gonna be going over selection, this
</text>
<text start="6658.309" dur="4.06">
should be brief, we&#39;re mainly just going to be discussing and overlooking examples of
</text>
<text start="6662.369" dur="5.931">
material designs website, because the selection will be discussed heavily once we start talking
</text>
<text start="6668.3" dur="5.37">
about states, which is our next video in the interaction portion of the foundation section
</text>
<text start="6673.67" dur="4.279">
of this course. So if we go ahead and click on in our exercise
</text>
<text start="6677.949" dur="6.36">
file selection, it is a link that we can access. And essentially in selection, it just talks
</text>
<text start="6684.309" dur="5.98">
about how it refers to how users indicate specific items they intend to take action
</text>
<text start="6690.289" dur="3.56">
on. And when they&#39;re taking action on item, there
</text>
<text start="6693.849" dur="4.931">
are several ways to take an action on an item. And we&#39;ll cover that deeply in the states
</text>
<text start="6698.78" dur="4.01">
portion, which is the next video in this course, that you&#39;ll be watching next.
</text>
<text start="6702.79" dur="2.749">
So we&#39;re just going to be doing a brief overview right now.
</text>
<text start="6705.539" dur="5.11">
And you&#39;ll notice that a lot of this documentation covers interaction on mobile devices, but
</text>
<text start="6710.649" dur="2.99">
we&#39;re specifically going to be talking about the desktop portion.
</text>
<text start="6713.639" dur="5.951">
But I will in in figma when we develop when we create our components.
</text>
<text start="6719.59" dur="6.699">
But here you&#39;ll notice I touch on both talking about selection in mobile and on desktop.
</text>
<text start="6726.289" dur="5.031">
And I would heavily pay attention to the desktop portion, although the mobile portion is just
</text>
<text start="6731.32" dur="4.449">
as important if not more important. And anyways, let&#39;s get started.
</text>
<text start="6735.769" dur="7.35">
So on touch devices, select items require you to either do a long press touch on your
</text>
<text start="6743.119" dur="4.701">
device or a two finger touch. Or you can utilize a selection shortcut if
</text>
<text start="6747.82" dur="6.889">
that is available, such as tapping an avatar. And on desktop items with checkbox.
</text>
<text start="6754.709" dur="5.28">
checkboxes shouldn&#39;t display their checkboxes by default, or permanently unless the item
</text>
<text start="6759.989" dur="4.97">
selection is the primary activity in the UI. Instead, these checkboxes should only be displayed
</text>
<text start="6764.959" dur="5.871">
on hover as a single checkbox for that item, or upon selection of the first item after
</text>
<text start="6770.83" dur="4.359">
which checks boxes are displayed for remaining items in that set.
</text>
<text start="6775.189" dur="7.81">
so here we can see that the user is tapping, and then they do a, they&#39;re tapping to select
</text>
<text start="6782.999" dur="2.7">
an item. As you can see here, they were selecting that
</text>
<text start="6785.699" dur="4.21">
first item here. And they were entering a selection mode, where
</text>
<text start="6789.909" dur="6.8">
they selected an item enter selection mode. And then was then tapped again to exit out
</text>
<text start="6796.709" dur="4.151">
of that mode. And here&#39;s some other examples as well.
</text>
<text start="6800.86" dur="6.79">
It&#39;s just the user selecting multiple cards. And once each item is selected, they can tap
</text>
<text start="6807.65" dur="4.739">
them to toggle it selection state. So the user selects all the cards individually,
</text>
<text start="6812.389" dur="3.76">
one at a time. And then they select them again, to then D
</text>
<text start="6816.149" dur="4.191">select those items. So those are all selections.</text>
<text start="6820.34" dur="4.52">
And then that is another example here we can see another example of selection where users
</text>
<text start="6824.86" dur="7.31">
are long pressing and dragging across multiple items to quickly select several items at once.
</text>
<text start="6832.17" dur="3.94">
And you&#39;ll notice that they&#39;re selecting several items, because in the top left hand corner
</text>
<text start="6836.11" dur="7.559">
and the app bar, it is then updating the selection as the user is utilizing the selection.
</text>
<text start="6843.669" dur="5.171">
By long pressing and dragging across multiple items, the items being photos, and this example
</text>
<text start="6848.84" dur="4.089">here. So that is a great example.</text>
<text start="6852.929" dur="5.451">
And then on desktop, which is very important. It where you will see much more complicated
</text>
<text start="6858.38" dur="6.069">
variants of states, you&#39;ll see that the user is making a selection on and you&#39;ll see that
</text>
<text start="6864.449" dur="7.371">
on hover, it&#39;ll reveal that checkbox. So he there now D selecting and you&#39;ll notice
</text>
<text start="6871.82" dur="6.96">
that when the user hovers again, that the item reveals a checkbox, and the check checkbox
</text>
<text start="6878.78" dur="8.6">
can then be clicked and clicked once again to D select that row, that line item.
</text>
<text start="6887.38" dur="5.4">
And that is very important to note and we can also see that there are other variants
</text>
<text start="6892.78" dur="4.489">
of of this here documented. This is a short and sweet article.
</text>
<text start="6897.269" dur="4.531">
I highly recommend you reading through all of it just briefly Understand selection.
</text>
<text start="6901.8" dur="7.899">
Today we&#39;re going to be talking about understanding layout in material design.
</text>
<text start="6909.699" dur="5.47">
And we&#39;re going to go over some very simple principles that we&#39;re going to be using throughout
</text>
<text start="6915.169" dur="4.361">
the entirety of this course moving forward. And we&#39;re going to go over some examples and
</text>
<text start="6919.53" dur="2.04">components. And here I have a couple links.</text>
<text start="6921.57" dur="4.509">
So we&#39;re gonna start off by going ahead and opening this link, if you&#39;d like to read through
</text>
<text start="6926.079" dur="4.361">
the information, or you can just follow along with me, I already have these links open,
</text>
<text start="6930.44" dur="5.039">
and essentially material design in order to ensure consistency across all the platforms
</text>
<text start="6935.479" dur="5.131">
or environments, and screen sizes that they designed for, they adhere to three simple
</text>
<text start="6940.61" dur="7.25">
principles. Ensuring that when you are implementing a
</text>
<text start="6947.86" dur="5.379">
layout that is predictable, consistent and responsive across all those platforms, and
</text>
<text start="6953.239" dur="3.811">
here, you can see those definitions. So they ensure that they are predictable by
</text>
<text start="6957.05" dur="5.549">
using intuitive and predictable layouts with consistent UI regions and spatial organization
</text>
<text start="6962.599" dur="7.69">
by using these measurements here, and of course, consistent layouts, while using the grids,
</text>
<text start="6970.289" dur="3.86">
key lines, and padding. So we&#39;ll heavily be using grids, and padding,
</text>
<text start="6974.149" dur="5.861">
of course, and of course, ensuring that these layouts are adaptive.
</text>
<text start="6980.01" dur="6.709">
And they react to input from a user, whether it&#39;s a device, or some other screen elements.
</text>
<text start="6986.719" dur="6.041">
So here you can see some of the baseline measurements, material uses and materials line layouts are
</text>
<text start="6992.76" dur="5.759">
visually balanced. And to achieve that balance, most of their
</text>
<text start="6998.519" dur="6.12">
measurements are components when they&#39;re designed, aligned to an eight dip grid that is applied,
</text>
<text start="7004.639" dur="5.9">
which aligns both spacing, and it aligns to the overall layout as well.
</text>
<text start="7010.539" dur="6.801">
And smaller components, such as icons, or typography can align to a four dip grid.
</text>
<text start="7017.34" dur="4.79">
And also think of that as four pixels. So what is that exactly? So if we go to figma,
</text>
<text start="7022.13" dur="6.71">
we can go ahead and build a frame, maybe we want to choose a generic MacBook Pro screen
</text>
<text start="7028.84" dur="5.129">
layouts, I just choose the macro pro pro screen layout, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and add a grid.
</text>
<text start="7033.969" dur="4.871">
And typically most of the content aligns to an eight pixel grid or eight dip grid.
</text>
<text start="7038.84" dur="5.069">
So I can do that by just choosing having this grid type here for my lab grid and set that
</text>
<text start="7043.909" dur="3.27">size to eight. And that is my eight.</text>
<text start="7047.179" dur="4.42">
That&#39;s my baseline grid grid here set to eight dips, or eight pixels, you could say.
</text>
<text start="7051.599" dur="6.511">
So there&#39;s an eight, here&#39;s your eight pixel grid here, and you can start designing your
</text>
<text start="7058.11" dur="3.969">
whatever it is to the grid, which is very essential.
</text>
<text start="7062.079" dur="5.16">
And we will use that as needed. And of course, when you&#39;re designing several
</text>
<text start="7067.239" dur="4.59">
elements, so we have some text here, this is very low level and not accurate, just this
</text>
<text start="7071.829" dur="6.37">
is just to give you a general idea, this typography of will of course aligned to the grid here.
</text>
<text start="7078.199" dur="4.24">
And then I can ensure to space it by eight pixels, as you can see here.
</text>
<text start="7082.439" dur="4.41">
And then if I duplicate into that space by eight pixels, and notice that when you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="7086.849" dur="4.15">
designing and you break down the spacing, and as you design components, it will always
</text>
<text start="7090.999" dur="6.44">
be divisible by eight or four. So here, we have some measurements here starting
</text>
<text start="7097.439" dur="5.73">
from zero, and, and then incrementing by four dips every time.
</text>
<text start="7103.169" dur="5">
So 04 812, all the way to 80. And more often than not, you&#39;re going to be
</text>
<text start="7108.169" dur="10.05">
using the spacing up here in the top spacing, which is either set to 816 20 430-240-4856
</text>
<text start="7118.219" dur="5.76">
647 to an ad, and every now and then you&#39;ll probably use for when you need to apply tighter
</text>
<text start="7123.979" dur="4.17">
spacing to smaller components such as icons or typography.
</text>
<text start="7128.149" dur="3.49">
So with that being covered, we&#39;ll go ahead and talk about those measurements in the in
</text>
<text start="7131.639" dur="3.451">
the next page. But right before that, we&#39;re gonna talk about
</text>
<text start="7135.09" dur="4.529">
the responsive login route. So mature designs responsive layout grid is
</text>
<text start="7139.619" dur="5.291">
an overarching guide to the placement of components and elements so that they adapt to screen
</text>
<text start="7144.91" dur="4.259">
sizes and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts.
</text>
<text start="7149.169" dur="4.231">
And the three things that they implement in their responsive grid layout is of course,
</text>
<text start="7153.4" dur="5.92">
columns gutters and margins. So here, you can see that margins are to the
</text>
<text start="7159.32" dur="5.819">
very far right and very far left of the screen in this in this green color here.
</text>
<text start="7165.139" dur="5.431">
And then we have our columns, which are this shade of red here that&#39;s not red, I must be
</text>
<text start="7170.57" dur="3.489">
colorblind, so I apologize. And that is our column label there.
</text>
<text start="7174.059" dur="5.85">
And then our gutters, of course, is the spacing between the columns, which are on the far
</text>
<text start="7179.909" dur="3.871">
right far left of the screen, which are the of course margin.
</text>
<text start="7183.78" dur="3.9">
So I&#39;m gonna actually build an example of that out in figma here really quick, so we
</text>
<text start="7187.68" dur="6.529">
have this eight dip baseline grid here, so I&#39;m just gonna label that frame.
</text>
<text start="7194.209" dur="4.591">
So we have the eight dip baseline grid, and then I&#39;m gonna go ahead and duplicate that.
</text>
<text start="7198.8" dur="3.239">It&#39;s on a Mac Book. Pro screen.</text>
<text start="7202.039" dur="2.941">
And I&#39;m going to go ahead and create a responsive grid layout, I&#39;m going to remove this, I could
</text>
<text start="7204.98" dur="5.8">
keep this if I wanted to add another grid layout, and change that to columns.
</text>
<text start="7210.78" dur="4.6">
And what we can do is ensure that this type of grid is set to stretch because that means
</text>
<text start="7215.38" dur="4.06">
it will be a responsive layout grid or you could call it adaptive.
</text>
<text start="7219.44" dur="2.65">
Or you could say fluid. That is another common term.
</text>
<text start="7222.09" dur="4.089">
I&#39;m going to add 12 columns here, or we could check how many columns were implemented in
</text>
<text start="7226.179" dur="6.69">
this grid 368 columns, when it looks like they&#39;re potentially designing for a tablet,
</text>
<text start="7232.869" dur="3.86">
here we have a grids, you&#39;ll notice that all the columns here are set to read.
</text>
<text start="7236.729" dur="3.171">
And I can change the opacity of that to really point that out.
</text>
<text start="7239.9" dur="4.269">
So we have eight columns here, but we don&#39;t actually have margins yet this, what we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="7244.169" dur="4.091">
trying to achieve here is add these margins, which are labeled in green here.
</text>
<text start="7248.26" dur="4.669">
And we&#39;ll set that to 24 pixels, we have the margin parameter and figma there.
</text>
<text start="7252.929" dur="3.02">
So I&#39;ve set that 24 pixels. And you&#39;ll notice that it kind of squished
</text>
<text start="7255.949" dur="2.73">those columns in so I squish those columns in.</text>
<text start="7258.679" dur="5.951">
And now I&#39;m going to change this gutter from the default 20 pixels or points to 16.
</text>
<text start="7264.63" dur="7.48">
Because that is commonly used as well. And it also perfectly aligns with our our
</text>
<text start="7272.11" dur="4.52">
grid are eight pixel baseline grid as well. So that is an example of how to build this
</text>
<text start="7276.63" dur="3.56">
out. But now, I&#39;m going to actually stretch the
</text>
<text start="7280.19" dur="5.63">
screen because this is responsive. So you&#39;ll notice as I move this frame, essentially,
</text>
<text start="7285.82" dur="7.21">
the components you design that will be attached on the screen, and adhering to the column
</text>
<text start="7293.03" dur="6.389">
layout or the grid layout on the screen will also be responsive as you as you start to
</text>
<text start="7299.419" dur="3.41">
stretch it around. Because as you all know, we have web browsers
</text>
<text start="7302.829" dur="5.222">
and we can stretch those around and it becomes responsive figma itself, the tool is responsive,
</text>
<text start="7308.051" dur="6.559">
as you can see. But that is an example there a responsive
</text>
<text start="7314.61" dur="3.739">
grid layout. So now that we have that specified, that is
</text>
<text start="7318.349" dur="3.281">
fantastic. We&#39;ll go ahead and start to see how the measurements
</text>
<text start="7321.63" dur="5.71">
are implemented in components. So in our in our exercise file, if we click
</text>
<text start="7327.34" dur="6.109">
on app bar components, we can go ahead and open that link, which will open a a material
</text>
<text start="7333.449" dur="2.561">
design page. And if you go ahead and follow me and click
</text>
<text start="7336.01" dur="6.879">
on the specs here in the contents category, you&#39;ll see that we have a bunch of bottom
</text>
<text start="7342.889" dur="4.641">
app bars, which are mobile only components. And what the important thing to get out of
</text>
<text start="7347.53" dur="7.589">
this is that we&#39;re seeing a bunch of specs provided on how to design these elements.
</text>
<text start="7355.119" dur="6.531">
So here you can see that this is this hamburger menu is wrapped in a 24 by 24 frame.
</text>
<text start="7361.65" dur="7.839">
And we have a floating action button that is set to 56 by 56, dips in width and height,
</text>
<text start="7369.489" dur="4.5">
which utilizes elevation on the Z index to rise above this bottom app bar as you can
</text>
<text start="7373.989" dur="5.15">
see here, and then you can see the spacing between these icons as well is such 24 dips,
</text>
<text start="7379.139" dur="5.891">
and then it has some padding or you could say margins on the right set to 16 dips.
</text>
<text start="7385.03" dur="6.779">
And it the height of the of these elements, which are these icons are centered within
</text>
<text start="7391.809" dur="5.1">
this bottom app bar. And the height of that is set to 24 dips.
</text>
<text start="7396.909" dur="2.88">
So there&#39;s some measurements there. And you can continue to scroll down and view
</text>
<text start="7399.789" dur="6.73">
other variations of this floating action button. As you can see here, there are other variations
</text>
<text start="7406.519" dur="5.22">
with more specifications provided here. So there&#39;s eight dips between this floating
</text>
<text start="7411.739" dur="3.76">
action button and the whitespace there to the bottom app bar background.
</text>
<text start="7415.499" dur="5.27">
Again, more, notice that all of this is divisible by eight or four.
</text>
<text start="7420.769" dur="5.571">
So understanding that this is all very consistent at a very low level.
</text>
<text start="7426.34" dur="3.859">
So it all starts from the ground up. Or you could say very primitive level, as
</text>
<text start="7430.199" dur="4.34">
these are primitive, such as icons, everything is divisible by eight or four.
</text>
<text start="7434.539" dur="5.29">
And also the spacing amongst all these elements is divisible by eight or four.
</text>
<text start="7439.829" dur="4.511">
And as well as the sizing of other components that are overlaid on top of this bottom app
</text>
<text start="7444.34" dur="4.45">
bar, which is fantastic and a great source of information for you to soak through.
</text>
<text start="7448.79" dur="5.63">
And we&#39;ll be getting into this very much soon. And that is all I have for you and understanding
</text>
<text start="7454.42" dur="6.36">
layouts. We&#39;re going to be talking about pixel density.
</text>
<text start="7460.78" dur="2.98">
And what that is exactly. So we&#39;re going to have an overview of that
</text>
<text start="7463.76" dur="5.139">
and then understand pixel density across different platforms such as iOS, Android, and for the
</text>
<text start="7468.899" dur="3.04">web. And what that means for each platform.</text>
<text start="7471.939" dur="5.151">
And I have the resource here, we can click on this link and just open it up.
</text>
<text start="7477.09" dur="5.92">
And once you have it opened up, you&#39;ll notice that it takes you to material designs documentation.
</text>
<text start="7483.01" dur="3.78">
And we&#39;re just going to be reading through this and I&#39;ll be explaining this to you and
</text>
<text start="7486.79" dur="5.919">
certain scenarios in which you would need to understand this and also just to all broaden
</text>
<text start="7492.709" dur="4.16">
your horizons as a designer if you already don&#39;t understand pixel density.
</text>
<text start="7496.869" dur="7.321">
So once you have to design for specific platform, you know exactly how to communicate measurements,
</text>
<text start="7504.19" dur="4.11">
for example. So say, communicating measurements for Android
</text>
<text start="7508.3" dur="6.29">
is completely different than communicating measurements for developers on the web, you
</text>
<text start="7514.59" dur="5.09">
know, or iOS, or Android. So understanding how to do conversions, for
</text>
<text start="7519.68" dur="7.029">
example, you may have, say, for example, I was building a Splunk.
</text>
<text start="7526.709" dur="5.381">
product for, which is the company I worked for, and this products already been released.
</text>
<text start="7532.09" dur="6.139">
And it was a application shipping for iOS. And I, myself had been a designer for the
</text>
<text start="7538.229" dur="3.99">web. And I was not aware of how to translate pixel</text>
<text start="7542.219" dur="5.9">
density from the web to iOS at the time. And essentially, that is a scenario where
</text>
<text start="7548.119" dur="3.25">
you would need to understand this. So I was providing that example.
</text>
<text start="7551.369" dur="3.09">
So let&#39;s, let&#39;s dive in. And we&#39;ll get into the rest later.
</text>
<text start="7554.459" dur="5.27">
So what is Hanks pixel density, screen pixel density and resolution vary depending on the

platform and pixel density is just the number of pixels that fit into an inch is referred
</text>
<text start="7565.919" dur="4.08">
to as pixel density. So it&#39;s the pixels per inch, how many pixels
</text>
<text start="7569.999" dur="3.15">
per inch. So you may have seen, if you&#39;ve printed paper
</text>
<text start="7573.149" dur="6.64">
out before, or printed out some graphics or something, it asks you in the settings before
</text>
<text start="7579.789" dur="6.571">
you print to specify how many pixels per inch, you want that to be printed at.
</text>
<text start="7586.36" dur="6.129">
So the lower the amount of pixels per inch, the lower the density is.
</text>
<text start="7592.489" dur="6.47">
And the more pixels per inch, the higher the density is, when you see that printed, or
</text>
<text start="7598.959" dur="7.711">
if when you see on a display, and they give you here in this documentation, a basically
</text>
<text start="7606.67" dur="7.09">
a formula on how to calculate pixel density. And it&#39;s just this equation where your screen
</text>
<text start="7613.76" dur="5.209">
density equals the screen width or height and pixels divided by the screen width or
</text>
<text start="7618.969" dur="5.601">
height in inches. And if you do that, you&#39;ll get your pixel
</text>
<text start="7624.57" dur="3.75">
density. So there&#39;s an example here visually, which
</text>
<text start="7628.32" dur="5.339">
is a really good example where this high density display has more pixels per inch than the
</text>
<text start="7633.659" dur="4.11">low density display here, and it zooms in on it.</text>
<text start="7637.769" dur="9.21">
And you&#39;ll notice that the you this UI element, as pixel dimensions appear larger on low density
</text>
<text start="7646.979" dur="5.72">
screens, and smaller on high density screens. So the more pixels you have, the smaller it&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="7652.699" dur="7.491">
appear on high density screens. And the lower that the pixel dimensions are,
</text>
<text start="7660.19" dur="5.849">
the larger it&#39;ll appear. So with that being said, we can jump on to
</text>
<text start="7666.039" dur="4.43">
talking about density independence, which refers to the uniform display of UI elements,
</text>
<text start="7670.469" dur="6.42">
on screens with different densities, and density independence.
</text>
<text start="7676.889" dur="5.27">
In material design is commonly pronounced as dips, which is the abbreviation dp here
</text>
<text start="7682.159" dur="4.351">
written as dp, and pronounces Dibs, they&#39;re flexible units that scale to have uniform
</text>
<text start="7686.51" dur="4.449">
dimensions on any screen. And they can provide a flexible way to accommodate
</text>
<text start="7690.959" dur="4.611">
a design across platforms. So for example, Material Design not only designs
</text>
<text start="7695.57" dur="6.409">
for the web, but also Android and iOS. So they use this terminology dips, which is
</text>
<text start="7701.979" dur="8.41">
their way to have a common language in design and engineering to accommodate designs across
</text>
<text start="7710.389" dur="5.721">
several platforms. And material, UI wise, use of density independent
</text>
<text start="7716.11" dur="5.69">
pixels, is to display elements consistently across screens, with different densities on
</text>
<text start="7721.8" dur="3.779">
those different platforms. So here, you can see a low density screen
</text>
<text start="7725.579" dur="5.56">
displayed with density independence here, where the low density makes it much more apparent,
</text>
<text start="7731.139" dur="3.741">
where you can see all these pixels here, which are all the squares, it&#39;s much more apparent
</text>
<text start="7734.88" dur="4.639">
on low density. And it is less, it is still apparent, but
</text>
<text start="7739.519" dur="8.511">
it is harder to see on high density, all the squares due to the high density screen displayed.
</text>
<text start="7748.03" dur="6.209">
And we now we can start to talk about the pixel density on it on a per platform basis
</text>
<text start="7754.239" dur="5.21">
where this pixel density on Android when you&#39;re developing on Android, or designing for Android
</text>
<text start="7759.449" dur="4.98">
use dips to display elements uniformly on screens with different densities.
</text>
<text start="7764.429" dur="4.851">
So that&#39;s how you would measure it. And it dip is, is equal to one physical pixel
</text>
<text start="7769.28" dur="6.02">
on a screen with a density of 160. And essentially what that and there&#39;s the
</text>
<text start="7775.3" dur="9.02">
equation here, again, being utilized. So essentially, a dip is one dip is one pixel.
</text>
<text start="7784.32" dur="4.89">
So don&#39;t let me confuse you. You could think of it as simple as that.
</text>
<text start="7789.21" dur="6.85">
One dip is one pixel. But dips are used for measuring on Android.
</text>
<text start="7796.06" dur="5.24">
So that is important to note. And also scalable pixels.
</text>
<text start="7801.3" dur="4.469">
The abbreviation for that as SP serves the same function as density independent pixels
</text>
<text start="7805.769" dur="5.04">
which are dips. But for fonts, the default value of a scalable
</text>
<text start="7810.809" dur="4.21">pixel is the same as the default value for a dip.</text>
<text start="7815.019" dur="5.54">
But for fonts, the primary difference between a scalable pixel and a density independent
</text>
<text start="7820.559" dur="5.96">
pixel is that scale will pixels preserve a user&#39;s font setting, which is super important.
</text>
<text start="7826.519" dur="4.991">
users who have larger text settings for accessibility will see font sizes match their text size
</text>
<text start="7831.51" dur="6.779">preferences. And again, pixel density on iOS.</text>
<text start="7838.289" dur="6.42">
The iOS based platform determines density using logical resolution, which means it just
</text>
<text start="7844.709" dur="7.62">
measures its units in points as opposed to pixels or dips, it uses points for measurement.
</text>
<text start="7852.329" dur="8.221">
And here, with their logical resolution, the points are scaled using a native scale factor,
</text>
<text start="7860.55" dur="3.639">
which is some technical knowledge for you to understand if you like, which just maps
</text>
<text start="7864.189" dur="4.91">
to a device&#39;s native resolution. So for example, if you&#39;re designing for the
</text>
<text start="7869.099" dur="7.971">
iPhone x, you would design for a logical resolution of 375 points by 112 points.
</text>
<text start="7877.07" dur="3.529">
And when it&#39;s rendered elements are processed by the graphics hardware.
</text>
<text start="7880.599" dur="7.381">
Now using this native scale factor functionality to fill in the iPhone Xs, dimensions, since
</text>
<text start="7887.98" dur="4.489">
the screen is much bigger. So it has the capabilities of understanding
</text>
<text start="7892.469" dur="6.45">
those points and scaling them accordingly to the device it&#39;s being displayed on.
</text>
<text start="7898.919" dur="5.14">
And units, again, for iOS use points, which remember that and then, of course, pixel density
</text>
<text start="7904.059" dur="6.941">
on the web scales to the devices, screen resolution, but when you&#39;re designing for the web, replace
</text>
<text start="7911" dur="4.209">
dips with pixels. So you can when you&#39;re designing products
</text>
<text start="7915.209" dur="6.95">
on the web, unless specified otherwise, by say engineers you work with and whatnot, you
</text>
<text start="7922.159" dur="8.53">
can just measure things in pixels. We&#39;re gonna go over some spacing methods,
</text>
<text start="7930.689" dur="5.41">
once more in material design, hear how they approach spacing, their elements, and they
</text>
<text start="7936.099" dur="3.56">
use terminology that is very useful that we&#39;re going to go over in the documentation.
</text>
<text start="7939.659" dur="5.71">
And in our exercise file here, we can go ahead and click on this link and figma, where we&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="7945.369" dur="3.81">
have access to opening the spacing methods page in figma.
</text>
<text start="7949.179" dur="3.741">
And we&#39;re going to go over everything in the contents here.
</text>
<text start="7952.92" dur="6.289">
And spacing methods are essentially just the use of baseline grids, key lines, padding,
</text>
<text start="7959.209" dur="5.66">
and incremental spacing to adjust certain ratios, containers and touch targets.
</text>
<text start="7964.869" dur="4.92">
A lot of this is very important. I know, it might be slightly boring.
</text>
<text start="7969.789" dur="7.671">
But this is very, this is a great resource for us learning, not only spacing for materials
</text>
<text start="7977.46" dur="5.099">
design system, but also applying this to any other systems we create or products we get
</text>
<text start="7982.559" dur="5.241">
to design moving forward. And here we have our baseline grid, where
</text>
<text start="7987.8" dur="5.08">
it just discusses how all components align to an eight dip square baseline grid for mobile
</text>
<text start="7992.88" dur="5.25">
tablet, and desktop. So we can go ahead and replicate that here.
</text>
<text start="7998.13" dur="4.4">
So here, you can see that the square is eight by eight dips, which is essentially just eight
</text>
<text start="8002.53" dur="4.54">
by eight pixels. If you were to design for the web, and here
</text>
<text start="8007.07" dur="5.19">
in figma, we&#39;re going to go ahead and create a screen that is set to the size of a MacBook
</text>
<text start="8012.26" dur="3.779">
Pro screen. And I&#39;m just going to label this a div baseline
</text>
<text start="8016.039" dur="3.92">
grid. So and then I&#39;m gonna apply a layout grid.
</text>
<text start="8019.959" dur="5.41">
So and then set the size to eight here and I now have a eight dip baseline grid that
</text>
<text start="8025.369" dur="6.23">
I can always that I can utilize to measure my elements here on this frame.
</text>
<text start="8031.599" dur="3.661">
So that is very important to note. And it&#39;s great to have.
</text>
<text start="8035.26" dur="7.199">
So that is a direct translation of how that is written out in the documentation, how to
</text>
<text start="8042.459" dur="5.361">
create that in figma. And we also have a four dip grid, where that
</text>
<text start="8047.82" dur="7.14">
is utilized in more dense areas such as icons type, and some elements with components that
</text>
<text start="8054.96" dur="4.69">
can align to a four dip grid. And if we wanted to create a four dip grid,
</text>
<text start="8059.65" dur="5.71">
honestly, all we have to do is duplicate this one, I can rename that to four dips.
</text>
<text start="8065.36" dur="7.46">
And then from there, I would need to Whoops, I had that set to 18 that should be at eight.
</text>
<text start="8072.82" dur="3.299">
So now that said eight, my apologies. And now that that&#39;s set to eight, I can go
</text>
<text start="8076.119" dur="5.971">
ahead and change this one to four. And now we have a four dip baseline grid and
</text>
<text start="8082.09" dur="5.819">
the eight to baseline grid. And the usages for those for those are specified
</text>
<text start="8087.909" dur="3.321">
here. So typography aligns to the four digit baseline
</text>
<text start="8091.23" dur="3.63">grid. And this typography can be placed outside</text>
<text start="8094.86" dur="5.65">
of the four dip grid when it&#39;s centered within a component, such as a button or list item.
</text>
<text start="8100.51" dur="3.6">
When it&#39;s placed outside of the grid, but centered within a component text can still
</text>
<text start="8104.11" dur="6.69">
appear vertically center aligned. As in this scenario, you can see that as well,
</text>
<text start="8110.8" dur="6.22">
it is a vertically aligned in the center of this list item right here.
</text>
<text start="8117.02" dur="4.88">
All although the type is placed outside of the four dip grid, so that is something important
</text>
<text start="8121.9" dur="4.219">
to note there. And then we&#39;re going to talk about some terminology
</text>
<text start="8126.119" dur="3.951">
that we&#39;ll be using frequently throughout the course when we build these components
</text>
<text start="8130.07" dur="4.509">
from scratch. So they&#39;re using these buttons as examples.
</text>
<text start="8134.579" dur="6.5">
So the spacing methods are more granular than the responsive grid layout, where it is a
</text>
<text start="8141.079" dur="4.591">
set of rules around how to place elements within layouts and components.
</text>
<text start="8145.67" dur="4.829">
So padding refers to the spacing here, between elements within a component.
</text>
<text start="8150.499" dur="4.821">
So you can see that there&#39;s padding to the left and right on this icon, and there&#39;s padding
</text>
<text start="8155.32" dur="2.54">to the left and right of this button on the right.</text>
<text start="8157.86" dur="6.609">
And that and that it is has alignment that is vertically centered within this button,
</text>
<text start="8164.469" dur="7.63">
which is expressed in this example. And this alignment spacing method example
</text>
<text start="8172.099" dur="6.56">
where the button with the plus icon is vertically aligned to the center within the button component.
</text>
<text start="8178.659" dur="6.63">
And of course, we have two mesh dimensions, which we&#39;ll be going over very much soon,
</text>
<text start="8185.289" dur="4.83">
where it describes the width and height of the components elements.
</text>
<text start="8190.119" dur="5.15">
So we&#39;ll know exactly how to size our components and the elements within them accordingly,
</text>
<text start="8195.269" dur="5.37">
by utilizing the dimensions, and then now it talks about specifically padding, and how
</text>
<text start="8200.639" dur="6.671">
it refers to the space between UI elements and how it is an alternative spacing method
</text>
<text start="8207.31" dur="3.95">
to key lines and as measured in increments of eight dips, or four.
</text>
<text start="8211.26" dur="3.559">
So again, you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s always divisible by eight or four.
</text>
<text start="8214.819" dur="4.941">
And padding can be measured both vertically and horizontally, and does not need to span
</text>
<text start="8219.76" dur="3.849">
the whole height of the layout. And of course, we have the dimension specified
</text>
<text start="8223.609" dur="5.16">
here for the component, the height here is set at eight as you can see, and it gives
</text>
<text start="8228.769" dur="6.84">
you the specs for the height of the app bar, which is set to 56 dips, and then the status
</text>
<text start="8235.609" dur="6.01">
bar height is set to 24 dips. And of course this list items at 88 dips.
</text>
<text start="8241.619" dur="6.211">
So this is important to refer to when we really need to ensure that our elements are pixel
</text>
<text start="8247.83" dur="5.349">
perfect, or in this case density independent pixel perfect.
</text>
<text start="8253.179" dur="3.3">
And then, of course, we have the alignment, which is the placement of elements in here,
</text>
<text start="8256.479" dur="5.071">
it&#39;s just giving you examples of elements being highlighted and discussing how they
</text>
<text start="8261.55" dur="3.639">are centered. So that is great.</text>
<text start="8265.189" dur="6.24">
And then we also have key lines. And it&#39;s a tool that enables consistent placement
</text>
<text start="8271.429" dur="5.361">
of elements outside of a layout grid. And they are vertical lines that show where
</text>
<text start="8276.79" dur="5.53">
elements are placed when they don&#39;t align to the grid key lines help you determine the
</text>
<text start="8282.32" dur="4.99">
distance between elements from the edge of the screen.
</text>
<text start="8287.31" dur="6.389">
And you can also measure in increments of eight and then also move helps you a lot in
</text>
<text start="8293.699" dur="3.841">
figma. So if I open up figma, and I create some text
</text>
<text start="8297.54" dur="4.979">here. And once I have that text created, I can go</text>
<text start="8302.519" dur="4.981">
ahead and even create a rectangle. Here, if I hold down Option, you&#39;ll notice
</text>
<text start="8307.5" dur="4.819">
that key lines appear. And I see that this is 240 pixels away to
</text>
<text start="8312.319" dur="5.2">
the left and this text. And I can measure from the edges of the screen.
</text>
<text start="8317.519" dur="3.971">
From the top edge, the distance between and the left edge and the bottom edge and even
</text>
<text start="8321.49" dur="4.27">
the very far right edge, as well as this two by just holding down option.
</text>
<text start="8325.76" dur="5.559">
Or Alt on Windows option on Mac. And those are my key lines that helps me specify
</text>
<text start="8331.319" dur="3.42">
the distance between elements. And we&#39;re going to be using this shortcut
</text>
<text start="8334.739" dur="3.961">
key all the time we&#39;re building components to ensure they&#39;re pixel perfect.
</text>
<text start="8338.7" dur="3.64">
So that is what key lines are. And you can also use rulers in figma.
</text>
<text start="8342.34" dur="6.27">
If I hit Shift R, you&#39;ll notice that in the canvas this, these set of rulers appear and
</text>
<text start="8348.61" dur="4.039">
you can measure to the distance between the rulers as well.
</text>
<text start="8352.649" dur="5.16">
And you can create a vertical or horizontal by just dragging from within the ruler and
</text>
<text start="8357.809" dur="3.941">
onto the canvas. And you can measure the distance between as
</text>
<text start="8361.75" dur="5.5">
long as you hold option hover over that read that ruler line or key lines, we could call
</text>
<text start="8367.25" dur="4.21">it and you can hide them by hitting shift R.</text>
<text start="8371.46" dur="5.59">
And those are how we&#39;ll use key lines. And next we&#39;ll talk about containers and ratios.
</text>
<text start="8377.05" dur="6.269">
And essentially containers a term that refers to an enclosed area.
</text>
<text start="8383.319" dur="5.911">
And essentially containers are composed of UI elements, such as images, icons or surfaces.
</text>
<text start="8389.23" dur="4.41">
So here we have an image container. Here we have an icon container and we have
</text>
<text start="8393.64" dur="7.3">
of course a surface container, which encapsulates a button and containers can Be rigid and restrict
</text>
<text start="8400.94" dur="3.19">the size of, or cropping of elements within them.</text>
<text start="8404.13" dur="6.34">
So you can utilize containers to crop images if they were in an image container, or even
</text>
<text start="8410.47" dur="5.349">
an icon container. But that, but it&#39;s typically utilized more
</text>
<text start="8415.819" dur="4.221">
often with image containers where you&#39;ll need to crop an image.
</text>
<text start="8420.04" dur="5.869">
But they can be flexible and grow to support the size of the content that it holds.
</text>
<text start="8425.909" dur="4.5">
As you can see, in these examples, we have a rigid image container, an example number
</text>
<text start="8430.409" dur="5.32">
one, which crops the original size of the image, or we have a flexible image container.
</text>
<text start="8435.729" dur="5.34">
And example number two, that holds the original image size as it scales.
</text>
<text start="8441.069" dur="5.33">
And then there are some important things to understand here where we talked about aspect
</text>
<text start="8446.399" dur="5.04">
ratios where the aspect ratio is a proportion of an element, its width to its height.
</text>
<text start="8451.439" dur="6.13">
And its aspect ratio is written as such width to height.
</text>
<text start="8457.569" dur="5.841">
And to maintain consistency, and your layout material design uses a consistent set of aspect
</text>
<text start="8463.41" dur="4.11">
ratios on elements like images, surfaces and screen sizes.
</text>
<text start="8467.52" dur="8.03">
And it is recommended for us to use this these set of aspect ratios across our UI.
</text>
<text start="8475.55" dur="3.88">
And you can see them here. So you can see some landscape formats where
</text>
<text start="8479.43" dur="6.591">
this ratio is graded. And then some some portrait formats as well.
</text>
<text start="8486.021" dur="5.048">
And it talks about flexible ratios, which is determined by the layout grid, where the
</text>
<text start="8491.069" dur="5.12">
container width is determined by the screen layout and grows to fill the maximum space
</text>
<text start="8496.189" dur="3.96">
available. So it&#39;s just referring to a responsive screen.
</text>
<text start="8500.149" dur="5.941">
And a container height is determined by the height of the image in the container with
</text>
<text start="8506.09" dur="5.649">
these flexible ratio principles, and you can use a flexible ratio to allow content form
</text>
<text start="8511.739" dur="5.441">
determine the height of the container, which is very common.
</text>
<text start="8517.18" dur="5.719">
And one of the most important things to understand is touch targets, and how touch targets apply
</text>
<text start="8522.899" dur="4.531">
to any device that receives both touch and non touch input.
</text>
<text start="8527.43" dur="6.969">
And this is these principles are used to balance information density and usability all in one.
</text>
<text start="8534.399" dur="6.201">
And touch targets should at least be a size of 48 by 48 dips, or 48 by 48 pixels with
</text>
<text start="8540.6" dur="4.15">at least eight dips of space between each target.</text>
<text start="8544.75" dur="8.74">
So you see that the dimension specified here. Although see this icon container is set to
</text>
<text start="8553.49" dur="5.02">40. By 40 dips, the tap target is set to 48 by</text>
<text start="8558.51" dur="3.78">48 dips. So that is very important.</text>
<text start="8562.29" dur="5.26">
And if you were to have another icon container next to it or any or a button, for example,
</text>
<text start="8567.55" dur="4.99">
it would have to be at least eight dips of space between the target so I can go ahead
</text>
<text start="8572.54" dur="6.97">
and do that. So say I had an icon here set to 40 by 40.
</text>
<text start="8579.51" dur="7.79">
I can I can specify this I can create a frame and then hold on option command to scale this
</text>
<text start="8587.3" dur="6.019">
to 48 by 48. And then I can center this and you&#39;ll notice
</text>
<text start="8593.319" dur="5.391">
that I&#39;ll change the background here to white, maybe a little slight red.
</text>
<text start="8598.71" dur="9.01">
And that red ref references the tap target. And the icon here is this circle and the tap
</text>
<text start="8607.72" dur="4.149">
target set to 48 or 48. But the icon itself is 40 by 40.
</text>
<text start="8611.869" dur="3.5">
So those are the dimensions for the tap target. And then if you were to create another element
</text>
<text start="8615.369" dur="4.031">
next to it, you would at least have to have a spacing of eight dips.
</text>
<text start="8619.4" dur="3.079">
So that is essentially what this is referencing here.
</text>
<text start="8622.479" dur="5.641">
And you can see that this button has a height of 36 dips, but the tap targets height is
</text>
<text start="8628.12" dur="3.239">set to 48 tips. So that&#39;s very important.</text>
<text start="8631.359" dur="5">
And you can see in the second example that there&#39;s an icon set to 24 by 24 dips, but
</text>
<text start="8636.359" dur="6.34">
the tap target is set to 48 by 48 dips. So that is a standard principle for accessibility,
</text>
<text start="8642.699" dur="8.671">
just to ensure that you can actually tap these elements on the interface correctly, and adheres
</text>
<text start="8651.37" dur="5.14">
to not only balancing information on your screen and usability, especially for impaired
</text>
<text start="8656.51" dur="3.849">
users, but it just allows for a more cohesive design.
</text>
<text start="8660.359" dur="7.3">
Today, we&#39;re going to go over the responsive grid layouts in material design.
</text>
<text start="8667.659" dur="6.28">
And we&#39;re going to be creating those in figma and as styles so that we can systematically
</text>
<text start="8673.939" dur="5.93">
reuse them across all our designs as needed and implementing them into our system.
</text>
<text start="8679.869" dur="6.131">
So here you can see that I&#39;ve taken some screenshots off of material designs website, which references
</text>
<text start="8686" dur="6.17">
all of the the breakpoints, so it discusses the breakpoint system here and also the breakpoints
</text>
<text start="8692.17" dur="7.89">
for how they designed for iOS devices. And we&#39;ll be going over not only creating
</text>
<text start="8700.06" dur="4.65">
Those istyles and figma. But before we jump into that, we&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="8704.71" dur="4.989">
to be talking about some key concepts and stuff to apply to our mental model and creating
</text>
<text start="8709.699" dur="5.651">
grids and designing. And some of those things being columns, margins
</text>
<text start="8715.35" dur="4.379">
and gutters when you&#39;re creating your grid, which we already know and have covered.
</text>
<text start="8719.729" dur="4.691">
And we&#39;ll go over that, again, to reiterate that, and ingrain that in your brain, and
</text>
<text start="8724.42" dur="8.019">
also some ways to customize the grid, whether it&#39;s horizontally or vertically, customize
</text>
<text start="8732.439" dur="7.25">
on the grid layout on those accesses, and discussing what you can and can&#39;t do, or at
</text>
<text start="8739.689" dur="4.26">
least some good best practices and not so good practices.
</text>
<text start="8743.949" dur="6.651">
And then of course, creating the styles, understanding grid behavior, mainly the differences between
</text>
<text start="8750.6" dur="4.671">
a fixed grid layout and a responsive grid layout, and then discussing UI regions.
</text>
<text start="8755.271" dur="5.379">
And what those are some examples on their web page, and then what white frames are,
</text>
<text start="8760.65" dur="5.629">
so we can go ahead and click on this resource here, open the link, and it will open up this
</text>
<text start="8766.279" dur="3.46">
responsive layout grid page on material designs website.
</text>
<text start="8769.739" dur="5.37">
And essentially, this responsive layout grid allows our designs to adapt to several screen
</text>
<text start="8775.109" dur="4.08">
sizes and orientations, ensuring consistency across all the layouts.
</text>
<text start="8779.189" dur="6.351">
And the general diagram describes what a responsive grid layout or just a grid layout in general
</text>
<text start="8785.54" dur="3.1">
it consists of. and it consists of columns, as you can see
</text>
<text start="8788.64" dur="5.29">
here, and gutters which are which are the which is the spacing between columns.
</text>
<text start="8793.93" dur="5.4">
And then the margins, which are on the very far left and far right of the screen laid
</text>
<text start="8799.33" dur="3.279">out in green here. Those are the margins.</text>
<text start="8802.609" dur="5.54">
And it talks in depth about columns, and how the content is placed in the areas of the
</text>
<text start="8808.149" dur="3.681">
screen that contained column. So you&#39;ll notice that generally, when you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="8811.83" dur="6.039">
designing on a grid layout that your designs or your components, snap to these columns.
</text>
<text start="8817.869" dur="3.771">
So as you can see, here, it snaps to the left and right edges of these two columns.
</text>
<text start="8821.64" dur="4.124">
So this, you could say this card takes up two columns, as well as the one to the right
</text>
<text start="8825.764" dur="4.095">
of it. And it utilizes that spacing in between, and
</text>
<text start="8829.859" dur="6.96">
the gutters to provide that consistent spacing. And so things are categorized in an organized
</text>
<text start="8836.819" dur="4.3">
fashion. So column width is defined using percentages
</text>
<text start="8841.119" dur="6.181">
rather than fixed values, which allows content to flexibly adapt to any screen size.
</text>
<text start="8847.3" dur="4.26">
So you&#39;ll notice when we create up create these grids here in figma, they&#39;re going to
</text>
<text start="8851.56" dur="4.61">
be very responsive. And the number of columns displayed in the
</text>
<text start="8856.17" dur="4.87">
grid is determined by the break point range. And the break point range here is specified.
</text>
<text start="8861.04" dur="4.48">
So from zero dips to 359 tips, or you could call those pixels if you&#39;re designing for
</text>
<text start="8865.52" dur="3.54">
the web. And you can see that we have ranges all the
</text>
<text start="8869.06" dur="7.43">
way for mobile devices here all the way to massive screens.
</text>
<text start="8876.49" dur="6.739">
And we&#39;ll be creating all of these. And here, we&#39;ll be creating all of these iOS
</text>
<text start="8883.229" dur="4.311">
grid layouts as well. And that is that for columns, and here are
</text>
<text start="8887.54" dur="8.18">
some examples on mobile at a 360 dip breakpoint using a four column grid layout here, as you
</text>
<text start="8895.72" dur="4.76">
can see four columns, Scott scoters, and margin specified as well.
</text>
<text start="8900.48" dur="6.35">
And you can see that on a tablet at a breakpoint of 600 dips wide, it uses a layout grid of
</text>
<text start="8906.83" dur="4.67">
eight columns. So as this screen expands, it goes from four
</text>
<text start="8911.5" dur="5.619">
columns to eight columns, which also allows for more content to be implemented on that
</text>
<text start="8917.119" dur="2.211">screen. So you can see that this row only has two</text>
<text start="8919.33" dur="3.56">
cards. And then when expands to a wider screen size,
</text>
<text start="8922.89" dur="6.25">
which is 600 dips in this example, it goes from two cards to four cards on that row.
</text>
<text start="8929.14" dur="4.31">
And here where it discusses gutters, and those are the spaces between the columns as it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="8933.45" dur="5.02">
highlighted here, and they help separate content. And those gutter widths are fixed values at
</text>
<text start="8938.47" dur="4.08">
each breakpoint. And to better adapt to the screen size.
</text>
<text start="8942.55" dur="4.649">
gutter width can change at different breakpoints. So wider gutters are more appropriate for
</text>
<text start="8947.199" dur="3.771">
larger screens as they create more whitespace between columns.
</text>
<text start="8950.97" dur="7.979">
So that way, information on the screen isn&#39;t as isn&#39;t as dense and cluttered as it can
</text>
<text start="8958.949" dur="4.061">
be if there are not wide enough gutters that larger screen sizes.
</text>
<text start="8963.01" dur="5.99">
So here you can see on a on mobile device at the breakpoint of 360 dips.
</text>
<text start="8969" dur="9.48">
This layout grid uses 16 dip gutters and on tablet on the breakpoint 600 dips wide.
</text>
<text start="8978.48" dur="6.63">
The layout grid uses 24 dip gutters specified here, and it&#39;s using those 24 dip gutters
</text>
<text start="8985.11" dur="4.869">
to separate the content. And now we can discuss margins which is a
</text>
<text start="8989.979" dur="4.941">
space between the content on the left and right edges of the screen as highlighted in
</text>
<text start="8994.92" dur="4.439">
green here on the left and right and these margin widths are defined as fixed values
</text>
<text start="8999.359" dur="1.5">at each break. point.</text>
<text start="9000.859" dur="4.051">
And this allows you to better adapt to the screen and the margin width can change at
</text>
<text start="9004.91" dur="3.659">
different breakpoints. Wider margins are more appropriate for larger
</text>
<text start="9008.569" dur="4.031">
screens as they create more whitespace around the perimeter of the content, as you can see
</text>
<text start="9012.6" dur="2.91">
here. So here&#39;s an example of margins on mobile
</text>
<text start="9015.51" dur="4.429">
on a small device using a layout grid of 16, dip margins.
</text>
<text start="9019.939" dur="5.861">
And then on a tablet at on a lot slightly larger device, the mobile, you&#39;ll notice that
</text>
<text start="9025.8" dur="5.91">
the margin increases from 16 to 24, dips here on the left and right margins.
</text>
<text start="9031.71" dur="4.8">
And now we can go ahead and talk about the customization of the grid and ways you can
</text>
<text start="9036.51" dur="4.3">
customize it, which allows you to meet the needs of both your product and the various
</text>
<text start="9040.81" dur="4.77">
device sizes you&#39;re designing for. So sometimes, you might need to customize
</text>
<text start="9045.58" dur="9.43">
gutters to have more space between content to create more to just to create more consistency.
</text>
<text start="9055.01" dur="5.13">
If spacing gets too tight at times, or, or if there&#39;s too much spacing, as you can see
</text>
<text start="9060.14" dur="6.57">
here, in this lab grid, it&#39;s using eight dip gutters here, very tight spacing, the tighter
</text>
<text start="9066.71" dur="5.04">
spacing may suggest images are closely related to one another so that they&#39;re perceived as
</text>
<text start="9071.75" dur="4.34">
a part of a collection. And here you can see that this layout grid
</text>
<text start="9076.09" dur="5.97">
uses much larger gutters set to 32 dips to create more separation between columns.
</text>
<text start="9082.06" dur="6.76">
And that extra space helps the album be perceived as individual entities within a collection.
</text>
<text start="9088.82" dur="5.839">
And one thing you shouldn&#39;t do that is recommended is to not make gutters too large, such as
</text>
<text start="9094.659" dur="4.32">
the same width as the columns too much space doesn&#39;t leave enough room for content and
</text>
<text start="9098.979" dur="3.531">
prevents it from appearing unified, and it just looks weird.
</text>
<text start="9102.51" dur="5.27">
All the spacing is just way too much. And also you can customize margins, margins
</text>
<text start="9107.78" dur="3.77">
can be adjusted to create more or less space between content.
</text>
<text start="9111.55" dur="5.74">
And the edge of the screen margins use a fixed value for each breakpoint.
</text>
<text start="9117.29" dur="7.24">
And it gives an example of typography here text, the ideal length for body copy is 40
</text>
<text start="9124.53" dur="6.15">
to 60 characters per line. So if you&#39;re going beyond that many characters
</text>
<text start="9130.68" dur="8.69">
per line, it could be an indication of you having to add more depth to your margins,
</text>
<text start="9139.37" dur="6.499">
increasing the margin space. And don&#39;t make margins so large that there
</text>
<text start="9145.869" dur="3.07">
isn&#39;t sufficient room for content. So you have to find that balance.
</text>
<text start="9148.939" dur="6.811">
So here&#39;s an example on mobile on a mobile breakpoint size 64 dip margins to limit the
</text>
<text start="9155.75" dur="5.09">
width and the content still looks proportionate, but doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t overwhelm the user.
</text>
<text start="9160.84" dur="6.7">
Whereas this is very dense and thin, just not good use of whitespace and too much space
</text>
<text start="9167.54" dur="3.27">in the margins. That example.</text>
<text start="9170.81" dur="8.46">
And here, we can talk about also the utilization of horizontal grids where Material Design
</text>
<text start="9179.27" dur="4.69">
layout grids can be customized for touch you eyes that scroll horizontally.
</text>
<text start="9183.96" dur="4.189">
So if you&#39;re for example, looking through a photo album or just scrolling on a browser
</text>
<text start="9188.149" dur="5.361">
on a tablet, or mobile device, columns, gutters and margins are laid out from left to right,
</text>
<text start="9193.51" dur="5.16">
rather than top to bottom, when you&#39;re creating a horizontal layout grid.
</text>
<text start="9198.67" dur="7.269">
In here, you can see that the margins are at the top and bottom of the horizontal grid
</text>
<text start="9205.939" dur="9.42">
layout, and the columns here set to four columns with a 400 height in depth 400 dips in height,
</text>
<text start="9215.359" dur="4.33">
which is great, we got that specified. And then we have the gutters as well, those
</text>
<text start="9219.689" dur="6.451">
same principles just a different orientation. And horizontal grids can be positioned to
</text>
<text start="9226.14" dur="5.799">
accommodate different heights allowing space for app bars and other UI regions or other
</text>
<text start="9231.939" dur="5.361">content that is fixed on the screen to begin with.</text>
<text start="9237.3" dur="4.389">
So you can squeeze that in there. And now that we&#39;ve discussed all that, we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="9241.689" dur="3.75">
going to be talking about building breakpoints in figma.
</text>
<text start="9245.439" dur="5.71">
At the very end, a couple more things to cover are UI regions.
</text>
<text start="9251.149" dur="5.13">
And essentially, UI regions are a layout, which is made of several UI regions such as
</text>
<text start="9256.279" dur="4.731">
side navigation that is fixed. So UI regions are typically fixed content,
</text>
<text start="9261.01" dur="6.019">
like the side navigation, the content area, and this app bar.
</text>
<text start="9267.029" dur="3.441">
These regions can display actions, content or navigation destinations.
</text>
<text start="9270.47" dur="3.53">
And these UI regions should be consistent across devices.
</text>
<text start="9274" dur="3.34">
And you&#39;ll notice that it gives you an example of that as it scales down.
</text>
<text start="9277.34" dur="4.53">
So it starts to like a desktop layout, and then a tablet layout, and then a mobile layout,
</text>
<text start="9281.87" dur="6.01">
and it talks about it shows you how it isolates the UI regions as it scales down, which is
</text>
<text start="9287.88" dur="5.91">
very important to increase familiarity of how this is done across devices as you scale
</text>
<text start="9293.79" dur="3.68">
up and down. When you&#39;re designing so you can ensure that
</text>
<text start="9297.47" dur="3.95">
you&#39;re properly adapting to different breakpoints have different screen sizes.
</text>
<text start="9301.42" dur="5.5">
And, again, I&#39;ll be touching upon how these UI regions are fixed.
</text>
<text start="9306.92" dur="4.42">
You can think of them as permanent UI regions that can be displayed outside of the responsive
</text>
<text start="9311.34" dur="5.71">
grid as well, like navigation drawer, where these regions cannot be collapsed.
</text>
<text start="9317.05" dur="6.2">
As you can see here, in this example above. And then we have persistent UI regions that
</text>
<text start="9323.25" dur="4.39">
can be displayed upon a command such as a hamburger menu where a menu slides in when
</text>
<text start="9327.64" dur="4.53">
you press it, and they can remain visible, or they can be toggled on or off to appear
</text>
<text start="9332.17" dur="4.26">
disappear. And when they appear, they condense both content.
</text>
<text start="9336.43" dur="5.41">
They condense both content and the grid. So you&#39;ll notice that it condenses that grid
</text>
<text start="9341.84" dur="6.45">
once that persistent UI region is toggled on, user presses it in this example, and then
</text>
<text start="9348.29" dur="6.42">
the content gets condensed. And which adheres to the grid, which is why
</text>
<text start="9354.71" dur="3.8">
the content is condensed. And then there&#39;s temporary UI regions, which
</text>
<text start="9358.51" dur="5.889">
do not affect the responsive grid. So this is an overlay example, when it&#39;s visible,
</text>
<text start="9364.399" dur="5.05">
they can be hidden by tapping an item in the region, or any space outside of the region.
</text>
<text start="9369.449" dur="7.631">
So this temporary region only appears temporarily and does not affect the responsive grid.
</text>
<text start="9377.08" dur="4.39">
And then we have this concept of white frames, which are structured layouts that provide
</text>
<text start="9381.47" dur="3.92">
a consistent approach to layout, and layering and shadows.
</text>
<text start="9385.39" dur="5.03">
And it&#39;s a great starting point meant to be modified to meet the specific needs of a product.
</text>
<text start="9390.42" dur="2.269">
So for example, you could think of this as a template.
</text>
<text start="9392.689" dur="8.67">
So you don&#39;t have to design the entire bare bones structure of a design, you can just
</text>
<text start="9401.359" dur="5.67">
grab a white frame to get started. Or this just gives you a really good start
</text>
<text start="9407.029" dur="6.231">
to designing your product, as opposed to building out all of this from scratch.
</text>
<text start="9413.26" dur="4.49">
So here you can see a mobile example of a white frame, which you can think of as a template,
</text>
<text start="9417.75" dur="3.26">
where you can then go in and plug in what you need into that interface.
</text>
<text start="9421.01" dur="6.62">
It&#39;s already built out for you from from the bare bones structure, and also a desktop example
</text>
<text start="9427.63" dur="3.3">
of that. So now with all that being said, and allows
</text>
<text start="9430.93" dur="5.591">
a lot to cover, we can go ahead and open up figma and start creating these these grid
</text>
<text start="9436.521" dur="5.878">
styles. So we can start by, I can grab this screenshot,
</text>
<text start="9442.399" dur="3.83">
and we&#39;ll do a couple together. And then the rest of this exercise, you&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="9446.229" dur="5.831">
be implementing these on your own as well. So here we have the first breakpoint, which
</text>
<text start="9452.06" dur="6.28">
is set from zero to 359, dips, I&#39;m going to create a frame specify that the width is set
</text>
<text start="9458.34" dur="8.43">
to 359, which is really thin size is set to portrait.
</text>
<text start="9466.77" dur="5.849">
And I don&#39;t really care about the height right now, because this is the we&#39;re just developing
</text>
<text start="9472.619" dur="7.441">
the grid layout for this width, not the height. So I&#39;m going to click on Create style here,
</text>
<text start="9480.06" dur="6.15">
this grid style, click on that layout grid settings icon and change that to columns.
</text>
<text start="9486.21" dur="8.519">
And you can see that it&#39;s set to four columns. And the margins and gutters are set to 16.
</text>
<text start="9494.729" dur="4.5">
And it is going to be responsive. So I&#39;m going to set that type to stretch.
</text>
<text start="9499.229" dur="4.811">
So I&#39;m going to set the margin to 16. And notice that my margins have now increased,
</text>
<text start="9504.04" dur="5.5">
there are now margins and then change the gutters to 16 as well which thickening the
</text>
<text start="9509.54" dur="5.43">
columns and tighten the spacing between content when we align it on this grid lab.
</text>
<text start="9514.97" dur="4.16">
So now we have this grid layout for this breakpoint range.
</text>
<text start="9519.13" dur="6.04">
And I can go ahead and now I can actually turn this into a style.
</text>
<text start="9525.17" dur="5.59">
So with that this lab group created, I can click on this style icon and click on the
</text>
<text start="9530.76" dur="4.83">
Create style. And what I can do is specify that this is
</text>
<text start="9535.59" dur="11.269">
an extra small grid layout. And I can even specify extra small at zero
</text>
<text start="9546.859" dur="9.29">
to 359 dip. And I can even specify I can categorize this
</text>
<text start="9556.149" dur="5.551">
because here you can see that we have a range of screen sizes from extra small in this column
</text>
<text start="9561.7" dur="7.56">
to small to medium to large. So I&#39;m going to specify this as extra small
</text>
<text start="9569.26" dur="6.019">
x small is a slash naming convention to categorize this.
</text>
<text start="9575.279" dur="9.17">
And now I can go ahead and name this as as such, so now it&#39;s extra small, and it&#39;s the
</text>
<text start="9584.449" dur="5.471">
first breakpoint from zero to 359 dips. This is what the grid will look like I can
</text>
<text start="9589.92" dur="4.519">
create that style. I can even go in edit and add a description
</text>
<text start="9594.439" dur="10.191">
and discuss that this is used for small hands sets.
</text>
<text start="9604.63" dur="4.269">
And yeah, that&#39;s all the information I really need to communicate to designers who are needing
</text>
<text start="9608.899" dur="2.111">to understand what this grid layouts used for.</text>
<text start="9611.01" dur="6.54">
So now I have that grid layout applied. Now I&#39;m going to duplicate this frame and
</text>
<text start="9617.55" dur="13">
remove this layout grid and ensure that I have this set to 360 pixels or so I can have
</text>
<text start="9630.55" dur="7.4">a frame any wide, anywhere from 360 to 399 dips.</text>
<text start="9637.95" dur="2.989">So I can even just change this from 359 to 360.</text>
<text start="9640.939" dur="6.281">
And width, or I can just increase it to 399 doesn&#39;t matter as long as it&#39;s within that
</text>
<text start="9647.22" dur="5.809">range. And because since this is a fluid layout,</text>
<text start="9653.029" dur="7.83">
it will automatically maintain and calculate the four columns between this bait breakpoint
</text>
<text start="9660.859" dur="4.62">
range and ensure that these margins and gutters are set to 16 at all times, and also four
</text>
<text start="9665.479" dur="5.871">
columns for this breakpoint range. So I can go ahead and create another layout
</text>
<text start="9671.35" dur="6.339">
grid style, click on the grid settings, specify the column, select the columns, ensure that
</text>
<text start="9677.689" dur="5.311">
there&#39;s four, I can even change the color of this, if I wanted to, I could change that
</text>
<text start="9683" dur="8.27">
to a blue and ensure that the type is set to stretch at 16.
</text>
<text start="9691.27" dur="5.5">
pixels are 16 dips to my margin and gutters and I now have that specified.
</text>
<text start="9696.77" dur="8.389">
And I can go ahead and close that out and create this as another grid style under the
</text>
<text start="9705.159" dur="5.471">
extra small category using that slash naming convention.
</text>
<text start="9710.63" dur="5.12">
And then from there, I&#39;m going to go ahead and specify the break point range which is
</text>
<text start="9715.75" dur="4.14">360 to 399. And I&#39;m going to write dp.</text>
<text start="9719.89" dur="6.53">
So people understand that this is the format for material design, which is dips, density
</text>
<text start="9726.42" dur="5.85">
independent pixels, I&#39;m going to create that style, I now have two grid styles here.
</text>
<text start="9732.27" dur="1.95">
And I&#39;m going to go ahead and create one more with you.
</text>
<text start="9734.22" dur="5.32">
And then I&#39;m going to challenge you to make another one the rest by yourself.
</text>
<text start="9739.54" dur="9.13">
So I&#39;m going to duplicate this and detach this style, create one from scratch, change
</text>
<text start="9748.67" dur="4.769">
this two columns. And here, I need to specify the width anywhere
</text>
<text start="9753.439" dur="7.871">
from 400 dips to form 79. So I&#39;m just going to select 479 lipsi 479
</text>
<text start="9761.31" dur="4.07">
on the width. Now that I have 479 specified, I&#39;m gonna click
</text>
<text start="9765.38" dur="7.42">
on my grid settings, and ensure that there are four columns, change the color of this
</text>
<text start="9772.8" dur="5.4">
grid again, to another shade of blue, just because I like blue, and then change the margin
</text>
<text start="9778.2" dur="4.59">
of 16 and the gutters to 16 as well. And it is set to stretch.
</text>
<text start="9782.79" dur="6.77">
So it will be responsive. And now I can turn this into a grid style,
</text>
<text start="9789.56" dur="10.98">
and specify that this is an extra small, whoops, extra small grid style.
</text>
<text start="9800.54" dur="5.699">
And then I can specify the breakpoint range. So it&#39;s 400 dips to 479.
</text>
<text start="9806.239" dur="6.87">
And quick, great stop. And I can even go ahead and add a description.
</text>
<text start="9813.109" dur="10.17">
So this one&#39;s typically used for large handsets, meaning large devices, large handset.
</text>
<text start="9823.279" dur="3.361">
And then now that I have that description there, I have my three styles.
</text>
<text start="9826.64" dur="5.92">
And now I challenge you to go ahead and make the rest of these styles here from 480 dips
</text>
<text start="9832.56" dur="3.04">
downward. And I&#39;m going to make pause this video and
</text>
<text start="9835.6" dur="3.12">make them myself. So I&#39;ll be right back.</text>
<text start="9838.72" dur="5.42">
Alright, so now that I&#39;ve created all the styles, you can compare what you&#39;ve created
</text>
<text start="9844.14" dur="6.219">
with me, compared to the grid styles. Here, I have all of the format specified here
</text>
<text start="9850.359" dur="6.62">
in this screenshot. And all these breakpoint ranges are clearly
</text>
<text start="9856.979" dur="5.041">
being reflected directly in the single file as grid styles, you can see that all these
</text>
<text start="9862.02" dur="5.339">
breakpoints are split by window size. So we have four extra small breakpoint sizes
</text>
<text start="9867.359" dur="5.04">
specified as grid sizes with the proper columns and margins.
</text>
<text start="9872.399" dur="4.38">
And of course, this is already in the exercise file for you to to view.
</text>
<text start="9876.779" dur="4.741">
And if you didn&#39;t make them from scratch, I highly recommend you do it&#39;s a great way
</text>
<text start="9881.52" dur="4.23">
to practice building grid styles. And I can almost guarantee you that by the
</text>
<text start="9885.75" dur="4.38">
time you finish creating this many grid styles, you&#39;ll know how to do that.
</text>
<text start="9890.13" dur="8.819">
And it&#39;ll be just something very, very simple for you to do and you have that skill as a
</text>
<text start="9898.949" dur="5.091">
designer from here on out which is very useful. You know, it&#39;s like the back of your hand.
</text>
<text start="9904.04" dur="4.42">
And as you can see here, I have all these styles all the way up to the extra large size
</text>
<text start="9908.46" dur="8.93">
wishes for any breakpoints at the size, the width of nine 1920 pixels or wider.
</text>
<text start="9917.39" dur="3.639">
And we have all of those examples specified here in this file.
</text>
<text start="9921.029" dur="6.021">
And as a bonus exercise, you can go ahead and even create all the iOS breakpoints, if
</text>
<text start="9927.05" dur="4.8">
you like, as those are specified here. And one tip is if you create a frame, and
</text>
<text start="9931.85" dur="4.509">
you go to frames, you have all sorts of formats for your iPhone formats here.
</text>
<text start="9936.359" dur="7.971">
So you can just select an iPhone format, and then implement a grid layout.
</text>
<text start="9944.33" dur="4.97">
And just selecting your column layout, specifying how many columns are necessary, the majority
</text>
<text start="9949.3" dur="6.529">
of them utilize four columns for the for this compact version here are just for the the
</text>
<text start="9955.829" dur="4.961">
first three set of sets of iPhones are the first for both.
</text>
<text start="9960.79" dur="4.149">
In portrait and landscape, you&#39;ll notice that the orientations are different.
</text>
<text start="9964.939" dur="5.38">
So you would probably you&#39;ll need to create a grid for a horizontal landscape as well.
</text>
<text start="9970.319" dur="7.201">
So do take that into consideration where you&#39;ll not use columns, but you&#39;ll use rows to specify
</text>
<text start="9977.52" dur="4.209">
your grids. So that is very important to take into consideration.
</text>
<text start="9981.729" dur="6">
As you&#39;re building these, I recommend you challenging yourself, and doing that and creating
</text>
<text start="9987.729" dur="3.151">
those styles as well. So you could even go ahead and create that
</text>
<text start="9990.88" dur="4.479">
grid style. And you can specify that this is an iOS grid
</text>
<text start="9995.359" dur="5.84">
layout by providing that naming convention, they&#39;re using the slash to categorize them
</text>
<text start="10001.199" dur="7.75">
as grid styles for the iOS breakpoint. And then you can just specify iPhone portrait.
</text>
<text start="10008.949" dur="5.37">
And you now have that iOS variant grid style. So if I go in and create a frame, and I go
</text>
<text start="10014.319" dur="4.231">
to my grid styles, you&#39;ll notice that I&#39;ve categorized them, I have extra small grids
</text>
<text start="10018.55" dur="4.04">
have small grid styles, choose from medium grid cells, and large ones, and extra large
</text>
<text start="10022.59" dur="3.019">
and of course, an iOS one. So you can go ahead and build those out as
</text>
<text start="10025.609" dur="5.42">
well, which is very helpful. good exercise for you.
</text>
<text start="10031.029" dur="7.391">
And you&#39;ll notice to some of you may have question, Why make so many grid styles.
</text>
<text start="10038.42" dur="6.609">
If, say, for example, all these small extra small formats, all use the same amount of
</text>
<text start="10045.029" dur="4.04">
columns and gut margins and gutters. That&#39;s a great question.
</text>
<text start="10049.069" dur="5.37">
And since this is a responsive layout, technically, you don&#39;t even need to make all four of these,
</text>
<text start="10054.439" dur="7.17">
I was solely making all four of them to replicate the preciseness of this break point system
</text>
<text start="10061.609" dur="4.92">
in this table specified by material design. So if you want to go ahead and actually consolidate
</text>
<text start="10066.529" dur="4.87">
these to the minimum amount of grid styles necessary, you can go ahead and do that.
</text>
<text start="10071.399" dur="6.71">
And in reality, you would actually only need three grid styles, you would need the extra
</text>
<text start="10078.109" dur="6.181">
small and the small. Actually, you&#39;ll need three grid style.
</text>
<text start="10084.29" dur="6.47">
So you would need the grid style that is for these breakpoints for these first four breakpoints
</text>
<text start="10090.76" dur="5.65">
here, these extra smalls with the four columns, and margin and gutter set to 16 dips.
</text>
<text start="10096.41" dur="6.23">
And then you&#39;d have a second one for the small breakpoint for the small tablet where the
</text>
<text start="10102.64" dur="3.17">
it&#39;s set to eight columns and 16 margin and gutters.
</text>
<text start="10105.81" dur="7.049">
And then you have a third one set to breakpoint for large tablets where the columns are eight.
</text>
<text start="10112.859" dur="5.771">
But the margins of gutters are set to 24. And then for every other device, you would
</text>
<text start="10118.63" dur="9.689">
have 12 columns and 24 dip margin and gutters. So essentially, you only have 1234 grid styles,
</text>
<text start="10128.319" dur="4.351">
you could consolidate those, and even go in and if you consolidated them, you could write
</text>
<text start="10132.67" dur="5.56">
a description for what breakpoints they applied to, which is also a great exercise, I recommend
</text>
<text start="10138.23" dur="5.749">
you doing that as well. Today, we&#39;re going to be building out all
</text>
<text start="10143.979" dur="5.242">
of the variants for the app bar, specifically the bottom portion of the app bar, which is
</text>
<text start="10149.221" dur="6.989">
where you can think of as some bottom navigation. And we have a link to the description of this.
</text>
<text start="10156.21" dur="4.25">
And it&#39;s a bottom map, app bar, which displays navigation and key actions at the bottom of
</text>
<text start="10160.46" dur="3.45">
the mobile screens. And since you&#39;ve been getting the hang of
</text>
<text start="10163.91" dur="4.38">
actually building this out with me, and even by yourself, I hope so you already have I
</text>
<text start="10168.29" dur="2.68">
hope you already have this down by now. That&#39;d be awesome.
</text>
<text start="10170.97" dur="6.639">
If not, we&#39;re going to go through this. You&#39;ll notice that we have four variations
</text>
<text start="10177.609" dur="4.771">
of this app bar. This bottom app bar, we have labeled as there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="10182.38" dur="5.33">
one with no floating action button. It&#39;s just a bunch of icons to access the different
</text>
<text start="10187.71" dur="7.75">
actions and we have the floating action buttons centered and you&#39;ll notice that there&#39;s some
</text>
<text start="10195.46" dur="4.35">
spacing here some intricate spacing there that will help to accommodate for newer designs.
</text>
<text start="10199.81" dur="7.72">
You And then we also have the floating action buttons center over the bottom app bar and
</text>
<text start="10207.53" dur="3.98">
those actions. So what we&#39;ll do is in figma, have all the
</text>
<text start="10211.51" dur="3.05">
screenshots, what we&#39;re going to do is create this one.
</text>
<text start="10214.56" dur="3.929">
And I&#39;m going to challenge you to create these two as it&#39;s very simple.
</text>
<text start="10218.489" dur="3.443">
We&#39;re going to create this one, get all the spacing, right, and then I want you to, I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="10221.932" dur="3.368">
going to pause the video, build these up by myself, and then have you build those out,
</text>
<text start="10225.3" dur="5.38">
challenge yourself to understand the, the specs here to build those out.
</text>
<text start="10230.68" dur="5.299">
And then we&#39;ll go over that. And then we&#39;re going to build out the center
</text>
<text start="10235.979" dur="6.981">
cut variant together as this might be challenging. But nothing is too challenging for us as we
</text>
<text start="10242.96" dur="3.01">
will be fig maestro&#39;s once this course is complete.
</text>
<text start="10245.97" dur="4.65">
So let&#39;s get started with creating this variant that the floating action buttons centered.
</text>
<text start="10250.62" dur="2.92">
So for those of you who don&#39;t know, this, this is probably this is generally designed
</text>
<text start="10253.54" dur="6.34">
for Android as this is materials design system. And the specs are set to 360.
</text>
<text start="10259.88" dur="2.88">
Width by 640. But essentially, you don&#39;t have to worry about
</text>
<text start="10262.76" dur="5.04">
the actual size of the background, where you do need to understand in your head have the
</text>
<text start="10267.8" dur="8.12">
mental model of responsiveness. So it will adhere to this spacing and whatnot,
</text>
<text start="10275.92" dur="6.33">
as it is being expanded in regards to width as you can see here.
</text>
<text start="10282.25" dur="5.67">
Just as an example, interactive example there. So let&#39;s get started by specifying the height
</text>
<text start="10287.92" dur="8.51">
of the background for this center, this app bar, so I&#39;m going to go ahead and now that
</text>
<text start="10296.43" dur="5.979">
we have the height of this, the width of the Android device specified, I can go ahead and
</text>
<text start="10302.409" dur="5.971">
change the height to 56. Now that we have that set of 56, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="10308.38" dur="5.71">
to change the background color. One thing we need to do not forget is enable
</text>
<text start="10314.09" dur="5.439">
our material design system library. And with that specified, go to my background
</text>
<text start="10319.529" dur="5.071">
colors and select on primary. And we need our icons now.
</text>
<text start="10324.6" dur="6.49">
So if we go to our assets panel, we can either search for them or type in hamburger, no results
</text>
<text start="10331.09" dur="4.94">
for hamburger, that&#39;s disappointing. Go to our material design system, check out
</text>
<text start="10336.03" dur="4.65">
our icons, and we can look for them. So there&#39;s the icon I need there, it&#39;s called
</text>
<text start="10340.68" dur="5.89">
reorder apparently, I can go ahead and click on this frame, hit Command V and it will paste
</text>
<text start="10346.57" dur="5.32">
it, what we need to do is remove this fill color, detach the style, select the style
</text>
<text start="10351.89" dur="5.389">
icon and apply the proper color, which is content on primary.
</text>
<text start="10357.279" dur="5.62">
And then I&#39;m going to hold on option A on this once I have this icon selected, Option
</text>
<text start="10362.899" dur="4.191">
A will snap it to the left of the frame. And then I&#39;m going to apply the proper spacing,
</text>
<text start="10367.09" dur="4.46">
it&#39;s set to 24 there. So I&#39;m just going to move this over a couple
</text>
<text start="10371.55" dur="4.66">times. Now that spacing set 24 centered.</text>
<text start="10376.21" dur="10.01">
And I can even just duplicate this icon to slowly showcase the the usage of placeholders.
</text>
<text start="10386.22" dur="4.179">As you can see, if I go ahead, set that set to 16.</text>
<text start="10390.399" dur="6">
I&#39;ve not duplicated it again. And I&#39;ll ensure the spacing is set to 16,
</text>
<text start="10396.399" dur="9.401">
again, between these two icons. So we have those set to eight to the right,
</text>
<text start="10405.8" dur="3.439">which we want to set to 16. So I push that over.</text>
<text start="10409.239" dur="2.321">
And we&#39;re good to go. We have our icon grants, if you want to be
</text>
<text start="10411.56" dur="8.9">
particular by our icons, you can search for them, we can look for them as well, in this
</text>
<text start="10420.46" dur="4.769">
library, I&#39;m gonna pause this and find those icons for you real quick.
</text>
<text start="10425.229" dur="7.851">
If you can&#39;t find icons, you can either search and the material design icons tool for the
</text>
<text start="10433.08" dur="2.59">icon. So I downloaded all those individually as</text>
<text start="10435.67" dur="5.279">
svgs just by clicking on them and then selecting download, but I&#39;ve already downloaded them
</text>
<text start="10440.949" dur="5.381">
for you and they&#39;re in this exercise file. So we can actually in your folder, so if you
</text>
<text start="10446.33" dur="6.46">
go to the proper section or components, so 2.1, you will have that that will be accessible.
</text>
<text start="10452.79" dur="5.25">
And what we can do is open up our finder and drag all three of these components onto the
</text>
<text start="10458.04" dur="2.59">
canvas. And we can go ahead and add the appropriate
</text>
<text start="10460.63" dur="3.05">
components now. But before I do that, I&#39;m going to change
</text>
<text start="10463.68" dur="5.03">
those colors, remove that fill there, go to selection colors, click on the style icon
</text>
<text start="10468.71" dur="5.019">
and set these to content on primary. And we&#39;ll be good to go.
</text>
<text start="10473.729" dur="3.331">So I can go ahead and actually replace these two.</text>
<text start="10477.06" dur="5.16">
So what I can do is individually drag these into the canvas shift click on this.
</text>
<text start="10482.22" dur="4.849">
And you&#39;ll notice that with the famous smart selection, I can hold down Option W and it&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="10487.069" dur="5.701">
snap this layer to the top and then I can swap them which is very helpful.
</text>
<text start="10492.77" dur="3.419">
So I can so I don&#39;t have to do all that resizing again there.
</text>
<text start="10496.189" dur="4.191">
The resizing is maintained. I can go ahead and drag these two Under the
</text>
<text start="10500.38" dur="8.36">
canvas, and individually swap these as well, I&#39;m going to hit option w so that the spacing
</text>
<text start="10508.74" dur="3.3">is not there, and they both align on that axis.</text>
<text start="10512.04" dur="7.239">
And then I&#39;m going to switch them, then delete. And just, I&#39;m going to center this one Shift,
</text>
<text start="10519.279" dur="4.911">
click it, and then I&#39;m going to swap those. Now I have all the desired icons that are
</text>
<text start="10524.19" dur="3.45">
reflected here. And we can go ahead and even pull in our neck
</text>
<text start="10527.64" dur="6.25">
our, our floating action button. And we want the regular one, which is this
</text>
<text start="10533.89" dur="3.24">
one and it&#39;s bigger and the thumbnail, as you can see, we can actually go ahead and
</text>
<text start="10537.13" dur="7.46">
drag this in onto our canvas. And with that done, what we&#39;re going to want
</text>
<text start="10544.59" dur="7.8">
to do is make sure that it&#39;s snapped, and it&#39;s horizontally centered here.
</text>
<text start="10552.39" dur="6.92">
So if we group it into our frame and, and then what we&#39;re going to want to do is click
</text>
<text start="10559.31" dur="5.179">
clip, uncheck clip content, click this and then hold down Option H.
</text>
<text start="10564.489" dur="4.101">
And that will center this because it was not centered option h now centered.
</text>
<text start="10568.59" dur="5.93">
We have these icons properly implemented. And we want these icons to have constraints
</text>
<text start="10574.52" dur="7.719">
that snap to the right and center vertically, because they are on the right side of this
</text>
<text start="10582.239" dur="3.29">
bottom app bar. And I&#39;m going to set this to instead of left
</text>
<text start="10585.529" dur="3.37">and top left and center it vertically on the axis.</text>
<text start="10588.899" dur="6.061">
So that way, when I resize this, the back the elements are, are vertically staying proportional
</text>
<text start="10594.96" dur="10.28">
in size, with the background, so it&#39;s all balanced, the icons are horizontally, proportionate,
</text>
<text start="10605.24" dur="7.46">
the sizing is there, and then vertically, it will stay proportionate as well as it scales
</text>
<text start="10612.7" dur="3.52">
in height. And then we have this one action button.
</text>
<text start="10616.22" dur="2.439">
The specs are all good, because we already built this component.
</text>
<text start="10618.659" dur="3.521">
And since it&#39;s part of our library, we just use the assets panel and drag it in build
</text>
<text start="10622.18" dur="4.799">
the component, which is super convenient. And we know that it&#39;s a part of this component,
</text>
<text start="10626.979" dur="6.64">
because I&#39;m actually clicking on the parent layer, holding down Command Shift H and hiding
</text>
<text start="10633.619" dur="2.12">
everything. So everything that&#39;s hiding is associated
</text>
<text start="10635.739" dur="6.551">
with the parent layer selected, which lets me know that this is an icon that I want.
</text>
<text start="10642.29" dur="4.989">
I mean, the component I want and it&#39;s layered accordingly.
</text>
<text start="10647.279" dur="10.161">
And again, these should all actually be icons. So what I can do is copy these go to my material
</text>
<text start="10657.44" dur="5.6">
design system, I can paste them in my system as needed.
</text>
<text start="10663.04" dur="13.97">
I&#39;m and then I can just apply this generic default color as the fill, so I can type in
</text>
<text start="10677.01" dur="4.4">
gray one. If you needed to long story short, this should
</text>
<text start="10681.41" dur="6.61">
just be set to I could just set it to that. And what I&#39;m essentially trying to get at
</text>
<text start="10688.02" dur="8.589">
is making sure that these are all main components, individually, publishing that to this library,
</text>
<text start="10696.609" dur="6.091">
can see I&#39;ve added these three new icons click publish, I&#39;ll organize them later.
</text>
<text start="10702.7" dur="5.24">
And we&#39;re going to actually swap those out. With these, these components, I&#39;m gonna show
</text>
<text start="10707.94" dur="3.661">
you a trick here. So if I go ahead and type search, there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="10711.601" dur="5.678">
my search icon. And if I hold down, up, if I go ahead and
</text>
<text start="10717.279" dur="4.931">
make all of these components, create multiple components.
</text>
<text start="10722.21" dur="6.399">
And I go to my assets panel again, drag this Hold OPTION command, it should swap it in
</text>
<text start="10728.609" dur="6.09">
place, but it&#39;s not. So we&#39;ll go ahead and manually do that my
</text>
<text start="10734.699" dur="7.471">apologies. So just grabbing all these icons here.</text>
<text start="10742.17" dur="13.979">
And then once we have everything, we&#39;ll go ahead and drag these into the canvas and do
</text>
<text start="10756.149" dur="12.54">
the same exact operation. Once these have all been swapped, we would
</text>
<text start="10768.689" dur="8.171">
be good to go. Okay, so now that that&#39;s all done, just apply
</text>
<text start="10776.86" dur="5.759">
the proper colors again, set the content on surface and we&#39;re good to go.
</text>
<text start="10782.619" dur="8.91">
So now we just need to name this layer accordingly. It is it falls under the app bars category.
</text>
<text start="10791.529" dur="5.981">
So there&#39;s a couple of categories here at bars, space slash space and then it falls
</text>
<text start="10797.51" dur="7.54">
under the bottom category of app bar. And this is the app bar with a floating action
</text>
<text start="10805.05" dur="5.16">
button, the bottom app bar with a floating action button that is centered.
</text>
<text start="10810.21" dur="7.25">
So once that is done, we are good to go, we can even apply constraints here to the right.
</text>
<text start="10817.46" dur="3.529">
So that always stays centered. Or actually, we want that to center horizontally.
</text>
<text start="10820.989" dur="3.111">
So it&#39;ll always stay center when we stretch the width.
</text>
<text start="10824.1" dur="4.389">
So now we have the width stretching, what we need to do is apply the constraints again
</text>
<text start="10828.489" dur="4.651">
to right and center vertically, and then left and center vertically.
</text>
<text start="10833.14" dur="6.32">
So now, when this element selected, and it stretches, it is stretching accordingly.
</text>
<text start="10839.46" dur="6.85">
And generally, the height won&#39;t stretch, since we have those specs set perfectly or properly.
</text>
<text start="10846.31" dur="3.53">
And then when we adjust the width, everything constraints accordingly, as if it were an
</text>
<text start="10849.84" dur="2.7">
app responsive layout. So we can go ahead and make this a main component.
</text>
<text start="10852.54" dur="4.6">
That&#39;s good to go. Now, I&#39;m going to pause this video, and I
</text>
<text start="10857.14" dur="5.099">
challenge you to make these two components here, it&#39;s actually really easy.
</text>
<text start="10862.239" dur="5.7">
Don&#39;t make them from scratch, just duplicate this layer, and detach the instance and then
</text>
<text start="10867.939" dur="3.481">
start removing and adding what&#39;s necessary for these two variants.
</text>
<text start="10871.42" dur="4.1">
And I&#39;ll be right back. Okay, so now that I&#39;ve created these, one,
</text>
<text start="10875.52" dur="4.589">
a couple things to point out is that you already have this in the exercise file, so you can
</text>
<text start="10880.109" dur="5.071">
check these and get up to speed or and just pay attention to the constraints.
</text>
<text start="10885.18" dur="3.99">
If you build it from scratch. Notice that this floating action buttons constraints
</text>
<text start="10889.17" dur="4.79">
at the top and right so it&#39;ll move accordingly. And then these are set to left and center
</text>
<text start="10893.96" dur="6.76">
vertically on this, all these icons on the left here these actions so that they are constrained
</text>
<text start="10900.72" dur="3.29">
proportionally. And then we have the bottom app bar with no
</text>
<text start="10904.01" dur="4.16">
floating action button. And we&#39;ll want to ensure that the constraints
</text>
<text start="10908.17" dur="3.68">
are set properly. So for example, if I click on this set of
</text>
<text start="10911.85" dur="9.45">
icons here, and set those to right and center, those will scale accordingly, horizontally
</text>
<text start="10921.3" dur="5.37">
and vertically. As well as this, this menu or hamburger menu
</text>
<text start="10926.67" dur="3.33">
actions. So those are the two I hope you enjoyed building
</text>
<text start="10930" dur="3.14">
by yourself. And last but not least, we&#39;ll go ahead and
</text>
<text start="10933.14" dur="7.11">
build out the bottom app bar with a floating action button that has the center cut.
</text>
<text start="10940.25" dur="3.33">
So it has this round cut in the middle of the background.
</text>
<text start="10943.58" dur="5.399">
And that&#39;s actually really easy to replicate, all we have to do is create an ellipse that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="10948.979" dur="6.561">
set to 72 by 72. Once that&#39;s once you specify those settings,
</text>
<text start="10955.54" dur="6.47">
ensure that it has the right background color, so surfaces on background but not for the
</text>
<text start="10962.01" dur="4.099">
stroke whoops, so that for the background itself of the fill.
</text>
<text start="10966.109" dur="7.331">
And then what I did was I just ensured that I created a proper rectangle for the background
</text>
<text start="10973.44" dur="4.539">
color, which was set to primary. And I set the proper dimensions to the width
</text>
<text start="10977.979" dur="3.64">
of an Android device and the proper height of this bottom app bar.
</text>
<text start="10981.619" dur="3.631">
And what I did was I just grouped them. And since they&#39;re grouped, and this is overlaid
</text>
<text start="10985.25" dur="4.81">
above, what we can do is utilize the subtract selection.
</text>
<text start="10990.06" dur="4.58">
So when I click subtract, it will create the proper spacing here.
</text>
<text start="10994.64" dur="7.17">
And the reason this ellipse is set to 72 is because it provides that eight pixel padding
</text>
<text start="11001.81" dur="4.65">
all the way around this white space right here, the swipe space is eight pixels all
</text>
<text start="11006.46" dur="5.081">
the way around. And so when we go ahead and build this, now
</text>
<text start="11011.541" dur="6.629">
I have this background. And I already have, what I did was I duplicated
</text>
<text start="11018.17" dur="7.63">
this component here and just attached it, it almost has all the same icons, except for
</text>
<text start="11025.8" dur="5.349">
the heart, which will swap later. Well, I can go ahead and do is remove the
</text>
<text start="11031.149" dur="4.861">
bill and actually add in a rectangle because we have the background color applied to the
</text>
<text start="11036.01" dur="1.929">frame. But in this scenario, we can actually apply</text>
<text start="11037.939" dur="4.481">
that subtract selection to the frame. So what we&#39;re going to go ahead and do is
</text>
<text start="11042.42" dur="4.54">
add this into the parent layer. So now it&#39;s a part of that frame, I can just
</text>
<text start="11046.96" dur="8.17">
go ahead and hit option A and W to snap option s Whoops, I need to undo real quick, I need
</text>
<text start="11055.13" dur="6.24">
to select my background. Center, I&#39;m gonna leave all that center cut
</text>
<text start="11061.37" dur="3.159">
background. And I&#39;m gonna hold down Command left bracket
</text>
<text start="11064.529" dur="3.79">
and that&#39;ll push all the way down to the bottom and hit option s and option W and that will
</text>
<text start="11068.319" dur="6.271">
snap it accordingly. And I now have the achieved look as needed.
</text>
<text start="11074.59" dur="5.319">
And we can go ahead and double check that set the pixels which it is the width is set
</text>
<text start="11079.909" dur="2.791">to eight. So that is awesome.</text>
<text start="11082.7" dur="3.18">We have the proper spacing set all the way around.</text>
<text start="11085.88" dur="6.08">
And that is how we create our center cut floating action with the floating action button for
</text>
<text start="11091.96" dur="3.58">
our bottom app bar. And just ensure that all of this is grouped
</text>
<text start="11095.54" dur="6.5">
properly, ensure that this spacing is correct. And our can straights are applied properly.
</text>
<text start="11102.04" dur="6.199">
And you&#39;ll notice that that background now needs to have constraints set properly.
</text>
<text start="11108.239" dur="6.421">
So if I go ahead and stretch this now, it will maintain that spacing.
</text>
<text start="11114.66" dur="4.89">
But with that center cut, it will be much easier for you to communicate in development,
</text>
<text start="11119.55" dur="5.812">
what is actually going on with that background. So, that is something important to note, what
</text>
<text start="11125.362" dur="8.888">
we can do is, since this is a selection, we can make sure that centered horizontally and
</text>
<text start="11134.25" dur="4.67">
slick that rectangle mixture that&#39;s stretches to the left and right at all time.
</text>
<text start="11138.92" dur="7.809">
So now, when we go ahead and move this around, it will actually move in alignment with the
</text>
<text start="11146.729" dur="6.351">
floating action button, which is awesome. And now that that is done, we have just, all
</text>
<text start="11153.08" dur="6.96">
we need to do is name this properly. So rename that fab center cut, and make that
</text>
<text start="11160.04" dur="3.48">
a main component. And we&#39;re good to go folks, everything&#39;s scaling
</text>
<text start="11163.52" dur="5.169">
properly, we just need to add that heart icon, we can go ahead and check that to see if we
</text>
<text start="11168.689" dur="5.101">
actually have that inner library, I don&#39;t. But again, we can just use the material design
</text>
<text start="11173.79" dur="8">
tool, icons, tool, materials, icons tool. And it&#39;s as simple as just typing in heart,
</text>
<text start="11181.79" dur="5.289">
I can go ahead and click that you already have this in your finder accessible.
</text>
<text start="11187.079" dur="5.591">
So with that, I&#39;m going to go open up figma, open up my Finder.
</text>
<text start="11192.67" dur="7.47">
And we have that favorite, I&#39;m going to add this to my icon library could have my icons
</text>
<text start="11200.14" dur="5.549">
over here. And I&#39;ll organize this later with that favorite,
</text>
<text start="11205.689" dur="6.651">
they&#39;re going to make that a main component, publish.
</text>
<text start="11212.34" dur="6.479">
And actually, since I didn&#39;t, if I type in favorite, actually already have this in the
</text>
<text start="11218.819" dur="1.811">
library, my apologies. So I have the favorite icon.
</text>
<text start="11220.63" dur="7.96">
I&#39;m gonna drag it in there, detach style, add the new on surface, content style content
</text>
<text start="11228.59" dur="6.569">
on primary, drag this into my component here, make sure it&#39;s vertically centered shift click
</text>
<text start="11235.159" dur="10.521">
and you smart selection to swap them quickly. And I have now replicated this exact screenshot.
</text>
<text start="11245.68" dur="8.57">
So we can go ahead and now organize all these. So with that said, I&#39;m just going to organize
</text>
<text start="11254.25" dur="6.37">
all these components and pause this video. organized everything I am good to go.
</text>
<text start="11260.62" dur="4.529">
I hope you enjoyed watching this video and understanding constraints more and again,
</text>
<text start="11265.149" dur="5.611">
later on in the auto layout section of this course, we will actually implement auto layout
</text>
<text start="11270.76" dur="5.4">
on the components as necessary. And I&#39;ll show you how to define and figure
</text>
<text start="11276.16" dur="3.73">
that out. We&#39;re gonna be talking about how to build
</text>
<text start="11279.89" dur="6.759">
out the top app bar component variants. So we&#39;ll have two of these in to be specific.
</text>
<text start="11286.649" dur="5.241">
And if we go ahead and click on the exercise file, here, we have the access to the documentation
</text>
<text start="11291.89" dur="5.17">
if you open that link, and once you open that link, and you&#39;ll notice that I&#39;m already there.
</text>
<text start="11297.06" dur="5.91">
And what this is used for is providing content actions related to the current screen, and
</text>
<text start="11302.97" dur="6.84">
also a great moment for utilizing your branding, screen titles navigation actions, which can
</text>
<text start="11309.81" dur="6.549">
then transform into a contextual action bar, which is just another set of actions.
</text>
<text start="11316.359" dur="3.661">
Based on what you&#39;re interacting on. In that screen.

Pan, there&#39;s two types of AP bars we&#39;re going to be creating.
</text>
<text start="11323.569" dur="2.382">
And we&#39;re not going to build these from scratch, we&#39;re actually going to reference what we
</text>
<text start="11325.951" dur="2.909">
have already created, which are the bottom app bar buttons.
</text>
<text start="11328.86" dur="4.009">And we can go ahead and end this exercise file.</text>
<text start="11332.869" dur="6.151">
If you save it, you can go ahead and I publish this already.
</text>
<text start="11339.02" dur="6.041">
And if you grab this exercise file, you will have to enable the material design system

<text start="11350" dur="6.76">
ahead and just search for app bars. And we have all the app bars.
</text>
<text start="11356.76" dur="3.75">
So we can go ahead and be a little more specific about what type of app bar we need.
</text>
<text start="11360.51" dur="5.09">
We clearly need the bottom app bar with no floating action buttons.
</text>
<text start="11365.6" dur="4.519">
And now that we have this, we have all the proper color styles as this puts us ahead
</text>
<text start="11370.119" dur="4.42">
I&#39;m just going to detach this style. I&#39;ve detached this instance My apologies I
</text>
<text start="11374.539" dur="5.941">
attached it from the main component. And what we have is a great starting point.
</text>
<text start="11380.48" dur="5.009">
And we have the page title here. And we got all the specs.
</text>
<text start="11385.489" dur="6.17">
So this menu is set at 24 pixels in the left, the height of this is set to 56.
</text>
<text start="11391.659" dur="6.25">
And you&#39;ll notice that there&#39;s also this little top portion what this is referencing is the
</text>
<text start="11397.909" dur="5.981">
system UI bar and We won&#39;t need to design for that that is solely a placeholder in this
</text>
<text start="11403.89" dur="4.02">
screenshot. So when we when engineers actually build this
</text>
<text start="11407.91" dur="7.43">
out, these components will just be snapped to the top, just below the system UI bar.
</text>
<text start="11415.34" dur="5.96">
So ignore that, which is why the specs are specified here 256, and not taking into consideration
</text>
<text start="11421.3" dur="4.54">
the height of the system, UI bar, just for some context there.
</text>
<text start="11425.84" dur="6">
And we got three icons here, got that more vertical icon, the search icon, this Share
</text>
<text start="11431.84" dur="5.21">
icon, I believe it is the title, this the page title, and then we got the Menu icon.
</text>
<text start="11437.05" dur="5.279">
So I can go ahead and delete that fourth icon because we&#39;re not going to need it.
</text>
<text start="11442.329" dur="4.171">
And I&#39;m going to rename this. So I don&#39;t get confused, because this is another
</text>
<text start="11446.5" dur="1.97">
set of app bars. But instead of being on the bottom, it&#39;s on
</text>
<text start="11448.47" dur="7.25">
the top, and we&#39;re creating the regular, we&#39;re just going to label this regular, as we already
</text>
<text start="11455.72" dur="5.77">
know, this is the regular top app bar. And with that being said, we need to go ahead
</text>
<text start="11461.49" dur="8.52">
and grab the prop the page style, understand what textile that&#39;s using, and we&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="11470.01" dur="7.08">
to just type in page obscures me, page title, add the proper style.
</text>
<text start="11477.09" dur="6.559">
So if I go ahead and select headers, we have variation of headers and subtitles.
</text>
<text start="11483.649" dur="3.371">
And we probably going to have to reference the documentation, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and
</text>
<text start="11487.02" dur="7.48">
click on the fill, apply the on primary content color, ensure that the resizing is set to
</text>
<text start="11494.5" dur="6.649">
auto width there, and vertically align that to the canvas, I don&#39;t have the right color,
</text>
<text start="11501.149" dur="2.8">
style, or font style. So I&#39;m going to reference the documentation
</text>
<text start="11503.949" dur="7.21">
to find that exact font size of the typography here to gain a Joe, get a general idea of
</text>
<text start="11511.159" dur="6.751">
what that is, you&#39;ll notice if you pay close attention is that this type Pog Rafi is smaller.
</text>
<text start="11517.91" dur="4.65">
And in this extended top app bar variant, it is a little bigger.
</text>
<text start="11522.56" dur="3.469">
So with that being said, we need to do some snooping.
</text>
<text start="11526.029" dur="9.221">
And there we have it, we have our category, the font size is set to h six in that scenario.
</text>
<text start="11535.25" dur="6.989">
We have the typography referenced again, stating that it&#39;s set to h six, h six right there,
</text>
<text start="11542.239" dur="5.25">
there&#39;s a bunch of examples. It&#39;s again, giving us the example of the H
</text>
<text start="11547.489" dur="3.501">six. So that is very important.</text>
<text start="11550.99" dur="4.749">
Now that we have that we can go ahead and just we have this as a color style.
</text>
<text start="11555.739" dur="6.2">
So I can go ahead and just select that, go to our textiles and select h six.
</text>
<text start="11561.939" dur="3.331">
So we have our h6 here. And we&#39;ll go ahead and center this.
</text>
<text start="11565.27" dur="4.32">
And this is set to 30 pixels to the left of this menu bar icon.
</text>
<text start="11569.59" dur="8.42">
So now that&#39;s set to 32. And we have it set to 16.
</text>
<text start="11578.01" dur="4.45">
On the left, I believe it&#39;s set to 24 currently, so I&#39;m going to shift click on the text and
</text>
<text start="11582.46" dur="4.699">
the I&#39;m going to click on this shift click on the menu icon, move this over one, I have
</text>
<text start="11587.159" dur="5.03">
my nudge amount and my preferences set to eight on the small nudge and one on the big
</text>
<text start="11592.189" dur="3.161">
nudge. So I can just quickly move things by increments
</text>
<text start="11595.35" dur="5.17">
of eight efficient effectively, as those are the measurement principles of this material
</text>
<text start="11600.52" dur="5.259">
design system. So now I have that page title set right here.
</text>
<text start="11605.779" dur="2.941">
And I&#39;m just going to focus on the alignment here, make sure that padding to the right
</text>
<text start="11608.72" dur="3.78">
set to 16. And the spacing between the icons is 24, which
</text>
<text start="11612.5" dur="6.39">it is. So if I go ahead and check that set to 24.</text>
<text start="11618.89" dur="5.38">
And I select these it&#39;s set to 16. On the right, the padding, the constraints
</text>
<text start="11624.27" dur="4.75">
are good to go, I can go ahead and apply the proper constraints to this typography by setting
</text>
<text start="11629.02" dur="5.62">
the vertical axis to center. And this icon already has left and center.
</text>
<text start="11634.64" dur="2.81">
So we&#39;re good to go. So if I were to scale this, it would all maintain
</text>
<text start="11637.45" dur="6.35">
its position or as the height increases, it would maintain that position on the y axis.
</text>
<text start="11643.8" dur="4.679">
So we have this variant built out. The only thing missing are the proper icons,
</text>
<text start="11648.479" dur="5.701">
which you can go ahead and add yourself. I&#39;m going to pause this and add them.
</text>
<text start="11654.18" dur="4.889">
So I&#39;ve identified all the proper icons. And I was missing one icon it was the share
</text>
<text start="11659.069" dur="4.851">
icon which falls under the actions category. So I just went to the material design icons
</text>
<text start="11663.92" dur="4.649">
tool, typed in share and I found it and I clicked on it saved it as an SVG, I saved
</text>
<text start="11668.569" dur="3.271">
you that step by just giving that to you in the exercise files.
</text>
<text start="11671.84" dur="3.761">
So you can drag that into your canvas and figma publish it to your material design system
</text>
<text start="11675.601" dur="4.039">
library, which is exactly what I did. I just published it, added it here made it
</text>
<text start="11679.64" dur="4.79">
a main component, published it and once I published it i was i since I have that library
</text>
<text start="11684.43" dur="4.181">
enabled in this exercise file, I was able to pull it from the assets panel here, and
</text>
<text start="11688.611" dur="4.609">
then I just swapped those accordingly. So now that all those specs are good to go,
</text>
<text start="11693.22" dur="5.17">
you could double check the spacing and whatnot if you needed to and ensure the constraints
</text>
<text start="11698.39" dur="5.15">
are set properly. And now we can go ahead and just check our
</text>
<text start="11703.54" dur="6.48">
layer, and it&#39;s labeled correctly. And I&#39;m going to make this a main component.
</text>
<text start="11710.02" dur="5.25">
So now that this is a whoops, I&#39;m going to select the top parent frame, and make that
</text>
<text start="11715.27" dur="7.04">
a main component, we now have our main component. Once that&#39;s there, we can go ahead and even
</text>
<text start="11722.31" dur="5.02">
duplicate this. And with that duplicated, I&#39;m gonna detach
</text>
<text start="11727.33" dur="2.949">
it. And we&#39;re going to specify the height of this
</text>
<text start="11730.279" dur="5.46">
element to be set to 128. But before I do that, I&#39;m gonna intentionally
</text>
<text start="11735.739" dur="3.561">
set some constraints. So the constraints are going to be applied
</text>
<text start="11739.3" dur="2.359">
to all the icons. So I&#39;m going to Command click on all these
</text>
<text start="11741.659" dur="7.081">
icons, which allows you to click these individually and maintain selection of the previous icon.
</text>
<text start="11748.74" dur="3.93">
So I have all these selected, and I&#39;m going to set this to top, because I don&#39;t want these
</text>
<text start="11752.67" dur="5.75">
to move when I set the height. And what I&#39;m gonna do is set this to bottom,
</text>
<text start="11758.42" dur="5.71">
and I&#39;m gonna shift click on this constraint to remove it and make sure that text is set
</text>
<text start="11764.13" dur="2.261">
to bottom. So what&#39;s going to happen is that, when I
</text>
<text start="11766.391" dur="6.069">
change the height of this element, the icons stick to the top, and the text will stick
</text>
<text start="11772.46" dur="4.609">
to the bottom. So I&#39;m going to change the height to 128.
</text>
<text start="11777.069" dur="4.181">
And it did exactly that. So now that that has been created, what I
</text>
<text start="11781.25" dur="5.63">
want to do is ensure that the baseline spacing is set accordingly.
</text>
<text start="11786.88" dur="3.42">
And you can see that they&#39;re specifying the baseline of the text, which is different from
</text>
<text start="11790.3" dur="3.26">
the bounding box of the text, it&#39;s set to 28 pixels.
</text>
<text start="11793.56" dur="5.309">
And we can easily do that by hitting shift our adding a red line to the baseline of the
</text>
<text start="11798.869" dur="3.931">
typography. And holding, we can hold down Option here,
</text>
<text start="11802.8" dur="7.58">
we can click the text, it&#39;s set to 16 here, but if we go ahead and create a textbox will
</text>
<text start="11810.38" dur="7.58">
notice that the height of this is set to 21. So what we also need to ensure is that we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="11817.96" dur="3.38">
using the right text style for this extended top app bar.
</text>
<text start="11821.34" dur="5.55">
So how do we do that, let&#39;s go ahead and reference our documentation on the top app bar.
</text>
<text start="11826.89" dur="6.74">
And you&#39;ll notice that the typography just reference that this was an H six.
</text>
<text start="11833.63" dur="6.189">
If we scroll down some more, this headline is an H six.
</text>
<text start="11839.819" dur="6.731">
But what about the extended top app bar, it&#39;s different, it&#39;s a different font.
</text>
<text start="11846.55" dur="9.37">
So we can go ahead and Google top app bar text size.
</text>
<text start="11855.92" dur="11.14">
So we can go ahead and continue to figure out what the size of the typography is by
</text>
<text start="11867.06" dur="6.259">
just Google searching, if you ever confused but if not actually going to open that page
</text>
<text start="11873.319" dur="6.271">
up again, once that&#39;s open, we might want to be able to access the developer guidelines
</text>
<text start="11879.59" dur="7.649">
and kind of snoop around there. And it&#39;ll give us access to the code.
</text>
<text start="11887.239" dur="6.641">
But what we want is access to this here. And understanding the topography.
</text>
<text start="11893.88" dur="8.809">
So the text appearance, and we&#39;re just reading some properties here.
</text>
<text start="11902.689" dur="5.581">
And what we really want to do is understand the textile being applied.
</text>
<text start="11908.27" dur="4.1">
So I&#39;m gonna pause this and look for that value.
</text>
<text start="11912.37" dur="8.279">
So I was not able to identify the actual title by by snooping through this typography, or
</text>
<text start="11920.649" dur="3.97">
at least the print the code here, don&#39;t get confused.
</text>
<text start="11924.619" dur="5.33">
Again, this practice I just went through this little exercise of searching for a specific
</text>
<text start="11929.949" dur="5.851">
attribute is a common practice, I&#39;d recommend for you to start understanding because it
</text>
<text start="11935.8" dur="10.46">
will really help you try to dissect and understand how to identify certain elements of a design
</text>
<text start="11946.26" dur="6.13">
by going through different sets of documentation, which is a great skill to have, and will improve
</text>
<text start="11952.39" dur="5.92">
your implementation of design as you can better articulate it to developers, as well as you
</text>
<text start="11958.31" dur="5.349">
continue to dive deeper into these types of Google searches and trying to understand how
</text>
<text start="11963.659" dur="3.341">
it&#39;s implemented. So I kind of just referenced the developer
</text>
<text start="11967" dur="5.34">
documentation and access that component page where it talks about top app bars.
</text>
<text start="11972.34" dur="2.18">
And I&#39;m kind of looking through the structure of this code.
</text>
<text start="11974.52" dur="2.54">So androids written in this format called XML.</text>
<text start="11977.06" dur="8.969">
That&#39;s the language in which they write their they write their code, or for the UI implementing
</text>
<text start="11986.029" dur="6.21">
implementing their UI. And I&#39;m looking at the prominent top app bar.
</text>
<text start="11992.239" dur="8.441">
And with that prominent top app bar, I&#39;m going and scrolling down and I found a set of properties
</text>
<text start="12000.68" dur="6.32">
that were communicated. And it talks about the title attributes that
</text>
<text start="12007" dur="7.829">
they use. So I went ahead and was looking for the top
</text>
<text start="12014.829" dur="7.851">
app bar, anything related to the top app bar attribute to see if I can then identify the
</text>
<text start="12022.68" dur="2.939">
size. So there&#39;s a bunch of other settings here
</text>
<text start="12025.619" dur="5.25">
as well, that are communicated. But specifically, we&#39;re looking for the type
</text>
<text start="12030.869" dur="2.691">title attributes. So that utilizes a title.</text>
<text start="12033.56" dur="4.04">
And the material toolbar title is set to an age six, which we&#39;ve specified.
</text>
<text start="12037.6" dur="10.219">
And then the material subtitle is set to subtitle one, and they also have a collapse title variant.
</text>
<text start="12047.819" dur="6.66">
And then they also have an expanded title, as you can see here, but we&#39;re gonna go ahead
</text>
<text start="12054.479" dur="8.281">
and just maintain the title we currently have. Again, if you know what that style is, do,
</text>
<text start="12062.76" dur="5">
please do go ahead and refine that. So I&#39;m going to go ahead and just I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="12067.76" dur="6.029">
to change that to subtitle since that is the one I was trying to identify.
</text>
<text start="12073.789" dur="3.83">
And if we go ahead and ensure that the baseline set to 28, we should be good to go.
</text>
<text start="12077.619" dur="5.99">
So I&#39;m gonna increase this rectangle to 28 pixels, push this slightly up, so the baseline
</text>
<text start="12083.609" dur="3.04">
is aligned now. So when I do my red lines, the baseline of
</text>
<text start="12086.649" dur="8.111">
the topography is now 28 pixels away from the bottom, which is what is specified in
</text>
<text start="12094.76" dur="4.96">
the extended top app bar, right here, 28 pixels, this green horizontal line.
</text>
<text start="12099.72" dur="4.929">
So now we are good to go. And all of the spacing is correct already
</text>
<text start="12104.649" dur="5.42">
on the icons above. And we just set constraints so that it would
</text>
<text start="12110.069" dur="3.431">
stay that way. So with that page title set there, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="12113.5" dur="2.729">
to make sure that the constraint set to left as well.
</text>
<text start="12116.229" dur="3.331">
So when we type in a new title, we&#39;re good to go.
</text>
<text start="12119.56" dur="7.219">
And with that said, I&#39;m just going to ensure that my spacing is set to on the left is set
</text>
<text start="12126.779" dur="3.12">accordingly. So it&#39;s set to 72.</text>
<text start="12129.899" dur="3.89">
We&#39;re good to go. And we&#39;re going to go ahead and name this
</text>
<text start="12133.789" dur="8.351">
extended, because it&#39;s our extended top app bar variant.
</text>
<text start="12142.14" dur="4.58">
And now that all the constraints are set, and we&#39;re good to go long, I&#39;m going to go
</text>
<text start="12146.72" dur="6.099">
ahead and make this a main component. And you can go ahead and organize this in
</text>
<text start="12152.819" dur="4.451">
this frame. And that is how we build out the top app our
</text>
<text start="12157.27" dur="5.37">
components. Today, we&#39;re going to be making some backdrop
</text>
<text start="12162.64" dur="4.219">
components. So we&#39;ll be building out the backdrop components
</text>
<text start="12166.859" dur="4.401">
over viewing them first building them out applying the proper constraints, and really
</text>
<text start="12171.26" dur="3.219">
going to need to understand and consume these components first.
</text>
<text start="12174.479" dur="5.13">
So if we go ahead and click on the backdrop documentation there, that&#39;ll open up in your
</text>
<text start="12179.609" dur="4.311">
default browser. And a backdrop appears behind all other surfaces
</text>
<text start="12183.92" dur="4.189">
in an app displaying contextual and actionable content.
</text>
<text start="12188.109" dur="7.681">
And one thing no currently, as of the date of this recording, September 10 2020, Thursday,
</text>
<text start="12195.79" dur="5.09">
this is currently in beta. Therefore, for developers referencing this.
</text>
<text start="12200.88" dur="4.229">
Currently, there is no status around when this will be developed for the following platforms
</text>
<text start="12205.109" dur="8.781">
Android, iOS web and the flutter framework. So that is important to note.
</text>
<text start="12213.89" dur="6.589">
And also, the backdrop is composed of two surfaces, right, so we have the back layer,
</text>
<text start="12220.479" dur="5.291">
which is the the blue looking layer there, right here, this top bar element, which is
</text>
<text start="12225.77" dur="4.86">
what essentially looks like and then the front layer, which is that has this white background
</text>
<text start="12230.63" dur="3.309">
and utilizes a little bit of elevation, whether you can see it or not.
</text>
<text start="12233.939" dur="6.04">
And the back layer displays actions and context and these control and inform the front layers
</text>
<text start="12239.979" dur="3.411">content. So whatever is on the background dictates</text>
<text start="12243.39" dur="5.66">
the front layers content. And that is important to note there.
</text>
<text start="12249.05" dur="4.96">
And it also utilizes an optional divider under the subtitle right there as we continue to
</text>
<text start="12254.01" dur="4.679">
analyze this backdrop component. And here&#39;s the anatomy breakdown of this backdrop
</text>
<text start="12258.689" dur="4.951">
component. It consists of a back layer, the front layer,
</text>
<text start="12263.64" dur="4.97">
and an optional sub header and divider there as you can see, and either the back layer
</text>
<text start="12268.61" dur="5.549">
or the front layer can be active at a time. So only one thing can be active, either the
</text>
<text start="12274.159" dur="4.46">
back layer or the front layer. And when the back layer is active, this this
</text>
<text start="12278.619" dur="7.25">
front layer drops down, utilizing motion. So here you can see that it&#39;s a fixed area,
</text>
<text start="12285.869" dur="5.08">
or at least, that&#39;s an optional way to utilize the sub header as a fixed area with content
</text>
<text start="12290.949" dur="3.951">
to scroll through and whatnot. And I highly recommend going through the rest
</text>
<text start="12294.9" dur="2.03">
of this and reading it and understanding the behavior.
</text>
<text start="12296.93" dur="5.25">
Right here. You can see that the front layer, as the back
</text>
<text start="12302.18" dur="6.09">
layer just lies on the surface and the front layer, utilize elevation, it&#39;s one dip on
</text>
<text start="12308.27" dur="4.31">
the Z index. one pixel on the Z index is also another way
</text>
<text start="12312.58" dur="3.649">
to reference it on the web. So that is important to note for our front
</text>
<text start="12316.229" dur="3.521">
layer there. And I&#39;ve already grabbed these screenshots
</text>
<text start="12319.75" dur="5.84">
for what, for designing the specs here, and you&#39;ll notice that it utilizes some list items
</text>
<text start="12325.59" dur="7.99">
in this example, which we&#39;ll go ahead and kind of build.
</text>
<text start="12333.58" dur="6.149">
So what we can do is go into figma here, what these screenshots reference, we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="12339.729" dur="6.911">
go ahead and create this generic example. Right, so we have is, we can search for app
</text>
<text start="12346.64" dur="5.219">
bar in our system, make sure your library is enabled the material design system library,
</text>
<text start="12351.859" dur="4.351">
and then you can search for app bar, and we have all these variants, right? So the variant
</text>
<text start="12356.21" dur="6.609">
we&#39;re gonna want to use is more than likely this one with page title, and you see that
</text>
<text start="12362.819" dur="4.091">
it has these other actions as well. And what I wanted to actually do is place
</text>
<text start="12366.91" dur="5.659">
this on a parent frame, and that parent frame is going to be the utilize the dimensions
</text>
<text start="12372.569" dur="5.491">
of the Android phone. So and I&#39;m going to rename this Android phone.
</text>
<text start="12378.06" dur="4.349">
So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and drag this in here and snap this to the top and left of the parent
</text>
<text start="12382.409" dur="5.441">frame. So great, we have what we need to start.</text>
<text start="12387.85" dur="4.349">
And it also indicates that the background set to blue still, so what we can do is add
</text>
<text start="12392.199" dur="7.301">
a primary background color to represent that in our example.
</text>
<text start="12399.5" dur="7.72">
And Android, Android phone backdrop, I&#39;m just going to rename that real quick to be precise.
</text>
<text start="12407.22" dur="6.95">
And what we can do is that this backdrop appears all the way to the top of this, this frame
</text>
<text start="12414.17" dur="4.819">
here. So I&#39;m going to go ahead and add a ruler here
</text>
<text start="12418.989" dur="6.221">in figma. that aligns with this selection here.</text>
<text start="12425.21" dur="4.97">
Get that pixel perfect there. And now with that ruler specified, I can go
</text>
<text start="12430.18" dur="6.389">
ahead and create another frame. And in this frame, is going to set the width
</text>
<text start="12436.569" dur="6.72">
to I&#39;m going to set this to surfaces surface, the background color and the width to span
</text>
<text start="12443.289" dur="6.731">
the entire body of the of the screen, which is 360 dips, I&#39;m going to snap this to the
</text>
<text start="12450.02" dur="2.91">
top. And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and select independent
</text>
<text start="12452.93" dur="4.719">
corners and ensure that the top and left are set to 16 pixels rounded.
</text>
<text start="12457.649" dur="5.311">
So we&#39;re achieving that same look here, as you can see, right there, and it utilizes
</text>
<text start="12462.96" dur="10.6">
a subtitle that has a baseline of 32 dips from from the top of the front layer.
</text>
<text start="12473.56" dur="4.19">
So I&#39;m going to label this layer, this frame front layer, because that is the background
</text>
<text start="12477.75" dur="1.979">
and there&#39;s going to be some text that lives within it.
</text>
<text start="12479.729" dur="6.711">
And I&#39;m going to ensure I have the proper textile specified and that is sub title.
</text>
<text start="12486.44" dur="3.4">
And I&#39;m gonna ensure that the resizing set to auto width.
</text>
<text start="12489.84" dur="5.42">
To keep that clear and concise, I can snap that to the top and left at 16 pixels 16 dips
</text>
<text start="12495.26" dur="3.309">to the left. And I can push this down.</text>
<text start="12498.569" dur="4.79">
And what I want to do is ensure that the baseline is set to 32 digits right there.
</text>
<text start="12503.359" dur="9.702">
So I can go ahead and do is grab, whoops, grab a rectangle, grab a rectangle, specify
</text>
<text start="12513.061" dur="7.239">
32 tips there. And then I&#39;m going to push this content up
</text>
<text start="12520.3" dur="4.37">
so that it aligns the baselines aligned. And I can justify that double check with a
</text>
<text start="12524.67" dur="1.89">ruler. And we are good to go.</text>
<text start="12526.56" dur="3.44">
That baseline is there. And one thing this optionally utilizes is
</text>
<text start="12530" dur="2.159">
a divider. So we&#39;ll go ahead and add that from the get
</text>
<text start="12532.159" dur="4.341">
go. I&#39;m gonna go ahead and searched for divider
</text>
<text start="12536.5" dur="4.42">
in my assets. And then I can go ahead and pull this divider
</text>
<text start="12540.92" dur="5.63">
in from my system. And the divider is approximately 12 pixels
</text>
<text start="12546.55" dur="8.92">
12 dips down from the subtitle. And what I&#39;m going to want to do is I&#39;m holding
</text>
<text start="12555.47" dur="6.31">
option command and shrinking this so that it&#39;s set to has a padding of 16 dips on the
</text>
<text start="12561.78" dur="7.749">
left and right of this other sub header which is reflective in in our examples up above,
</text>
<text start="12569.529" dur="6.471">
as you can see here. it aligns right there, that divider.
</text>
<text start="12576" dur="6.81">
So that&#39;s great that that is consistent. So now we have that and our textiles attached.
</text>
<text start="12582.81" dur="3.65">And everything looks good. We&#39;re good to go.</text>
<text start="12586.46" dur="10.25">
We can do now is just specify this as our bare bones layout because designers will then
</text>
<text start="12596.71" dur="7.24">
go ahead and add in the actual The items necessary to this component.
</text>
<text start="12603.95" dur="10.629">
So we have this this front layer here, if I go ahead and shrink this front layer expanded,
</text>
<text start="12614.579" dur="4.86">
and we now have a canvas for designer start adding content onto.
</text>
<text start="12619.439" dur="5.321">
So that&#39;s super important to note. So this in and of itself could be its very
</text>
<text start="12624.76" dur="9.76">
own component, what I&#39;m going to do is ensure that this color style specified to active
</text>
<text start="12634.52" dur="4.99">
with our high emphasis also known as high emphasis, and ensure it has the proper elevation
</text>
<text start="12639.51" dur="4.38">
set to one dip. So we can slightly see that elevation being
</text>
<text start="12643.89" dur="4.04">
utilized now. And with this, I&#39;m going to go ahead and make
</text>
<text start="12647.93" dur="8.179">
this a main component as this is one variation that designers could use this barebones layout,
</text>
<text start="12656.109" dur="6.241">
copy it, and then start adding their own elements on top of it, I can go ahead and specify the
</text>
<text start="12662.35" dur="4.52">
constraints because right now when I stretch it, this doesn&#39;t necessarily stick properly,
</text>
<text start="12666.87" dur="4.44">
it&#39;s always nice to specify that. So I got to set the constraints left and right,
</text>
<text start="12671.31" dur="5.61">
so now when I stretch this, it will stretch properly, the divider that is, so now we have
</text>
<text start="12676.92" dur="6.059">
our front layer expanded, and you can kind of see the elevation being utilized here.
</text>
<text start="12682.979" dur="4.401">
One thing that might be kind of confusing at first, creating this front layer that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="12687.38" dur="8.42">
expanded is that it&#39;s a blank canvas, right, so when a designer goes in and uses it, I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="12695.8" dur="5.5">
gonna align this here. So when a designer goes and uses this, it
</text>
<text start="12701.3" dur="7.019">
might be kind of misleading at first. So because what a designer is going to need
</text>
<text start="12708.319" dur="9.84">
to do is copy this. Whoops, I&#39;m going to kind of a swap, I put
</text>
<text start="12718.159" dur="6.291">the instance here. But that&#39;s okay.</text>
<text start="12724.45" dur="8.3">
We can do is go ahead and move that master now to this frame, front layer expanded.
</text>
<text start="12732.75" dur="7.96">
So that&#39;s, so with that expanded, we can go ahead and create the the concealed variant.
</text>
<text start="12740.71" dur="5.319">
And what I was trying to get at first is designers will copy that, copy this subtitle, and go
</text>
<text start="12746.029" dur="4.16">
ahead and add other elements onto it. So for example, the list items we created
</text>
<text start="12750.189" dur="5.63">
in the last video, I can go ahead, maybe I want to add into this component, right, I
</text>
<text start="12755.819" dur="3.731">
just need to ensure the proper spacing is specified.
</text>
<text start="12759.55" dur="5.019">
So what I want to do is, I&#39;m going to have to wrap this into a frame, right.
</text>
<text start="12764.569" dur="5.951">
So it&#39;s going to be my front front layer, expanded with content, so you&#39;re gonna have
</text>
<text start="12770.52" dur="6.87">
to wrap it into a frame, ensure that everything is aligning accordingly.
</text>
<text start="12777.39" dur="3.309">
And I&#39;m going to stretch this out to span the full width of this.
</text>
<text start="12780.699" dur="6.471">
And then what you can do is, then just continue to duplicate these items as needed.
</text>
<text start="12787.17" dur="7.729">
So that&#39;s great, and ensure that clip content is specified.
</text>
<text start="12794.899" dur="5.611">
And with clip content specified, you now have an example with content, just make sure that
</text>
<text start="12800.51" dur="5.309">
the proper padding is set to the top there. So we can go ahead and check that to see what
</text>
<text start="12805.819" dur="5.801">
that padding specified to right here from this list to the top of that divider.
</text>
<text start="12811.62" dur="4.34">And what we can do is always reference our specs.</text>
<text start="12815.96" dur="5.199">
So with our specs referenced, it looks like there&#39;s some spacing here.
</text>
<text start="12821.159" dur="5.412">
It&#39;s not necessarily specified. But we can go ahead and eyeball it roughly
</text>
<text start="12826.571" dur="6.658">
looks like 24 pixels there. And with that, we can go ahead and make sure
</text>
<text start="12833.229" dur="6.93">
that&#39;s set to 24, which it almost is entirely, I will just need to move this content down
</text>
<text start="12840.159" dur="4.83">one more pixel. And we should be good to go.</text>
<text start="12844.989" dur="2.7">There. And we have our example.</text>
<text start="12847.689" dur="8.17">
So as you can see, if we look at this frame, it wraps the front layer, which is the background
</text>
<text start="12855.859" dur="2.741">with all these list elements added on top of it.</text>
<text start="12858.6" dur="7.559">
As there may be several scenarios and how you want to use the the expanded front layer,
</text>
<text start="12866.159" dur="5.881">
you may want to add other type of content onto this expanded front layer on this backdrop.
</text>
<text start="12872.04" dur="4.98">
So we&#39;ll give you the bare bones layout and give you the freedom to add stuff on top of
</text>
<text start="12877.02" dur="2.679">it. And you can just do that by grouping and as</text>
<text start="12879.699" dur="6.12">
a frame of that content. And we&#39;ll go ahead and go check out the the
</text>
<text start="12885.819" dur="7.041">
concealed version and the concealed version refers to this, this front layer now being
</text>
<text start="12892.86" dur="6.919">
minimized, which is what I mean by concealed Material Design calls it concealed and the
</text>
<text start="12899.779" dur="11.87">
whole This is set to, let&#39;s see 48. So the height set to 48, we can go ahead and
</text>
<text start="12911.649" dur="6.411">
specify that here and snap that to the bottom, we now have that set to 48.
</text>
<text start="12918.06" dur="3.68">
And I&#39;m still using the same version I just stripped it.
</text>
<text start="12921.74" dur="10.089">
So I&#39;m going to do is detach this and label this front layer concealed.
</text>
<text start="12931.829" dur="3.641">
Remove that top constraint, set that to bottom left and right.
</text>
<text start="12935.47" dur="4.069">
So that stretches respectively. And there won&#39;t be a need for divider in this
</text>
<text start="12939.539" dur="5.261">
in this version, what there will need to be is an action, which is that carrot and I have
</text>
<text start="12944.8" dur="7.87">
one of those here, the up arrow, up keyboard arrow, so I&#39;m going to select that paste it
</text>
<text start="12952.67" dur="5.55">
and sure that that is centered here centered. And we have the padding set to 16 dips on
</text>
<text start="12958.22" dur="5.179">
the right, so we&#39;re good to go, we now have our concealed front layer variant, I&#39;m gonna
</text>
<text start="12963.399" dur="6.29">
go ahead and make that a main component. And duplicate this, grab the main component
</text>
<text start="12969.689" dur="9.281">
and drag it into our our canvas there. And it&#39;s still utilizing the the one dip elevation.
</text>
<text start="12978.97" dur="5.849">
So that&#39;s important to note. And we can even throw it in as it&#39;s, as you
</text>
<text start="12984.819" dur="5.561">
can see, it&#39;s now an example here. And what we haven&#39;t specified here is the
</text>
<text start="12990.38" dur="5.99">content for this. So I&#39;m just renaming that.</text>
<text start="12996.37" dur="6.01">
And essentially what you could do is create add whatever content you need here.
</text>
<text start="13002.38" dur="5.349">
So when this is concealed, there, the backdrop, the back layers being utilized.
</text>
<text start="13007.729" dur="5.221">
So if we go ahead and pay attention to Material Design documentation again.
</text>
<text start="13012.95" dur="4.339">
And we look at the anatomy of this backdrop, it has that back layer, right.
</text>
<text start="13017.289" dur="9.83">
And the backdrop has a has the original actions. And the front layer has actions respective
</text>
<text start="13027.119" dur="5.801">
to the actions on this back layer. So we&#39;re going to we can go ahead and make
</text>
<text start="13032.92" dur="5.5">
examples here. So we can go ahead and create these list items
</text>
<text start="13038.42" dur="6.34">
I can, I&#39;m going to go ahead and pull. I&#39;m going to go ahead and change.
</text>
<text start="13044.76" dur="9.14">
Let&#39;s see this to app name. And I&#39;m going to hide these icons here.
</text>
<text start="13053.9" dur="5.95">
And I can even go ahead and swap out this icon to an X.
</text>
<text start="13059.85" dur="8.129">
So I could find that exit icon. Or better yet, it&#39;s probably labeled close.
</text>
<text start="13067.979" dur="8.771">
Here we have that close icon. And we want to double check to see if we already
</text>
<text start="13076.75" dur="3.89">
have that here, which we do. So it&#39;s actually called clear.
</text>
<text start="13080.64" dur="3.799">
So I&#39;m going to look for clear here, my material design library.
</text>
<text start="13084.439" dur="4.63">
And I&#39;m going to drag this here and hold down Option command and hover over this icon and
</text>
<text start="13089.069" dur="8.51">
it&#39;ll swap it. And I&#39;ll change that to the the active on
</text>
<text start="13097.579" dur="4.172">
primary color, since this is on the primary surface there.
</text>
<text start="13101.751" dur="7.639">
And we&#39;re good to go to remove this hidden or turned off filler.
</text>
<text start="13109.39" dur="4.75">
So we have that specified. And what we want to go ahead and do now is
</text>
<text start="13114.14" dur="7.96">
we can bring in some some list items here, we can bring in the list item that utilizes
</text>
<text start="13122.1" dur="12.9">
a icon, this one line variant, right. And what we can even do is remove the background,
</text>
<text start="13135" dur="5.75">
we can change the color of the text to a content on primary surface.
</text>
<text start="13140.75" dur="10.43">
And now we have the ability to to we have the ability now to make push this content
</text>
<text start="13151.18" dur="3.24">
up a couple. So now this directly snaps to the top app
</text>
<text start="13154.42" dur="1.769">bar. And we have the ability to swap the icons</text>
<text start="13156.189" dur="2.5">now. So instead of using that placeholder, we can</text>
<text start="13158.689" dur="4.891">
use for example male, I can go ahead and swap that icon in here.
</text>
<text start="13163.58" dur="10.75">
Add the proper color to on primary. And as you can see we have our items now.
</text>
<text start="13174.33" dur="5.77">
And I want to actually make sure that that state is set to inactive My apologies.
</text>
<text start="13180.1" dur="8.89">
So that would be the the it should be utilizing the medium emphasis which isn&#39;t a color style
</text>
<text start="13188.99" dur="3.879">
right now which we can go ahead and specify in our library.
</text>
<text start="13192.869" dur="8.11">
So if we if we detach the style and hit 68 there, we now have our media emphasis color
</text>
<text start="13200.979" dur="5.18">style. So if I go ahead and specify that content</text>
<text start="13206.159" dur="9.471">
on primary, medium emphasis that could be our new color style there, which would be
</text>
<text start="13215.63" dur="4.29">
associated with the others. And long story short, now that we have this
</text>
<text start="13219.92" dur="5">
created, we need to change the height of this list item to 40.
</text>
<text start="13224.92" dur="7.689">
So you&#39;re noticing how I&#39;m starting to combine elements in our design system to to be utilized
</text>
<text start="13232.609" dur="5.061">
on top of other components such as these backdrops, which are like, which you can think of as
</text>
<text start="13237.67" dur="3.17">
these base layers, right. So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and just continue to
</text>
<text start="13240.84" dur="8.87">
duplicate this and we have now replicated our, our backdrop with the concealed front
</text>
<text start="13249.71" dur="3.39">layer. So this front layer is concealed there, we</text>
<text start="13253.1" dur="3.269">
can even go ahead and make this a component as well.
</text>
<text start="13256.369" dur="6.761">
Because more often than not, designers may be using this and if we make this a component,
</text>
<text start="13263.13" dur="5.75">
designers can go ahead and just swap these elements as needed and rename the text I these
</text>
<text start="13268.88" dur="7.47">
list items and whatnot, as mess deem necessary. So or we can give them the we can also offer
</text>
<text start="13276.35" dur="4.469">
we can offer both variants essentially right so we have the, the front layer conceal which
</text>
<text start="13280.819" dur="6.21">
they can just drag and drop onto onto a design as needed or we can give them this whole this
</text>
<text start="13287.029" dur="4.241">
whole example which I&#39;m going to go ahead and create.
</text>
<text start="13291.27" dur="9.57">
So I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to rename this so concealed, concealed.
</text>
<text start="13300.84" dur="5.99">
I&#39;m going to label this as concealed and then this is just the front layer concealed.
</text>
<text start="13306.83" dur="6.149">
So now that that is good to go, it is a master component, and we are good to go and that
</text>
<text start="13312.979" dur="5.621">
is how you build out the backdrop variants for material design.
</text>
<text start="13318.6" dur="5.599">
Today we&#39;re going to be building out banner components.
</text>
<text start="13324.199" dur="4.941">
And the only further ado, the overviews is going to be discussing how to use these components
</text>
<text start="13329.14" dur="4.46">
by checking out the documentation. And then we&#39;ll be creating them ourselves,
</text>
<text start="13333.6" dur="4.87">
applying the proper naming convention, and even adding the proper constraints and maybe
</text>
<text start="13338.47" dur="4.16">
a little bit of auto layout, but will actually save that auto layout and in depth video on
</text>
<text start="13342.63" dur="4.04">
auto layout, for the next section of the course will recover auto layout for all the components
</text>
<text start="13346.67" dur="3.909">
we&#39;ve created in this section of the course. But with constraints, the only difference
</text>
<text start="13350.579" dur="4.341">
will be that the components already made and we&#39;ll be implementing auto layout on them
</text>
<text start="13354.92" dur="2.819">
in the next section of the course. So without any further ado, let&#39;s check out
</text>
<text start="13357.739" dur="4.841">
this banner documentation resource and once that opens in your browser, go ahead and click
</text>
<text start="13362.58" dur="4.52">
on that will check box doesn&#39;t show up again for this website, as you&#39;ll be checking it
</text>
<text start="13367.1" dur="5.31">
out frequently. And here you can see that our got I got this
</text>
<text start="13372.41" dur="2.35">little too zoomed in. Whoops.</text>
<text start="13374.76" dur="5.679">
And with that, banners display opponent message and related optional actions.
</text>
<text start="13380.439" dur="5.021">
So here we have that prominent prominent message appearing at the top and then we have related
</text>
<text start="13385.46" dur="4.92">
optional actions to take based upon what is said in that prominent message.
</text>
<text start="13390.38" dur="3.369">
And you can go ahead and understand the usage here.
</text>
<text start="13393.749" dur="7.91">
And it also discusses similar similar components, and based on the priority of the message being
</text>
<text start="13401.659" dur="4.221">
conveyed conveyed, you can utilize a certain type of components.
</text>
<text start="13405.88" dur="6.59">
So for banners, typically when there is a prominent or our medium level type of priority
</text>
<text start="13412.47" dur="7.66">
based on the level of severity, if that priority is prominent or medium, it is typically you
</text>
<text start="13420.13" dur="6.649">
typically use a banner, and they will banners remain until dismiss by the user or if the
</text>
<text start="13426.779" dur="7.241">
state that caused the banner is resolved. And there&#39;s some differences described here
</text>
<text start="13434.02" dur="3.94">
with snack bars, and then the dialog component as well.
</text>
<text start="13437.96" dur="5.039">
And banner displays importance. Importance succinct message and provides actions
</text>
<text start="13442.999" dur="6.29">
for users to address or dismiss that banner requires a user action to be dismissed.
</text>
<text start="13449.289" dur="4.341">
And they should be displayed at the top of the screen below the top app bar.
</text>
<text start="13453.63" dur="5.24">
And they are persistent and non modal, allowing the user to either ignore them or interact
</text>
<text start="13458.87" dur="2.77">
with them at any time, only one banner should be shown at the time.
</text>
<text start="13461.64" dur="5.49">
Here are some principles and the anatomy of one of the most complex banner.
</text>
<text start="13467.13" dur="8.319">
As you can see, the most complex banner has a container with a supporting illustration,
</text>
<text start="13475.449" dur="4.41">
which you can also reference as the leading icon or an informative icon.
</text>
<text start="13479.859" dur="5.97">
Those are also common terms used. So the supporting illustration.
</text>
<text start="13485.829" dur="7.541">
And then here we have that container in encapsulating all of these elements in this design, and
</text>
<text start="13493.37" dur="4.05">
then we have the text, of course. And then we have the buttons are optional,
</text>
<text start="13497.42" dur="5.82">
I mean our supporting actions. And here are some examples of how to use it
</text>
<text start="13503.24" dur="5.28">
and how to not use it, only one banner should be shown at a time, any banner appears above
</text>
<text start="13508.52" dur="3.15">
content and below that bar. So here&#39;s the content right here below those
</text>
<text start="13511.67" dur="3.659">
images, the collection of those images. And then here we have the top app bar, and
</text>
<text start="13515.329" dur="3.7">
it fits right in between. So you can always you can think of it as always
</text>
<text start="13519.029" dur="5.41">
below the top app bar is where it would appear. And here&#39;s some more usages I recommend you
</text>
<text start="13524.439" dur="5.941">
going through to really understand the placement and behavior is that is very important.
</text>
<text start="13530.38" dur="3.41">
And then I have these screenshots on the specs on how to implement this.
</text>
<text start="13533.79" dur="3.569">
And we&#39;ll go ahead and reference the textile that we need.
</text>
<text start="13537.359" dur="4.741">
And the textile we need, as you can see here is the body to textile.
</text>
<text start="13542.1" dur="3.031">
And we&#39;ll go ahead and go into figma now and start building these out.
</text>
<text start="13545.131" dur="3.799">
And the first thing we&#39;re going to want to do is enable our material design system.
</text>
<text start="13548.93" dur="4.7">
So to start pulling in certain components that we&#39;ve already built, so we built this
</text>
<text start="13553.63" dur="5.79">
text button. And with that said, let&#39;s go ahead and build
</text>
<text start="13559.42" dur="1.569">that. So we have a frame.</text>
<text start="13560.989" dur="4.141">
And in this exercise file, I&#39;ve already created the the naming convention on how we want to
</text>
<text start="13565.13" dur="3.819">
categorize these banners. As you can see, there are mobile and desktop
</text>
<text start="13568.949" dur="2.151">
berets. So we&#39;ll go ahead and create all these, I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="13571.1" dur="3.97">
going to go ahead and create a, a one or two in each section.
</text>
<text start="13575.07" dur="5.44">
And then I&#39;ll pause the video and have you test your skills and build them out by yourself
</text>
<text start="13580.51" dur="3.96">
in a systematized manner. So utilizing as many of the assets we&#39;ve created
</text>
<text start="13584.47" dur="6.53">
already in our material design system here. So without further ado, let&#39;s get started.
</text>
<text start="13591" dur="4.88">
So we have this mobile variant, right, so we have the text and the action inline, meaning
</text>
<text start="13595.88" dur="3.869">
that they&#39;re both on the same level. They&#39;re not stacked on top of each other.
</text>
<text start="13599.749" dur="6.431">
They&#39;re horizontally in line, right, they&#39;re both on the same axis, the x axis was just
</text>
<text start="13606.18" dur="2.82">
horizontal. And what that said, we can go ahead and just
</text>
<text start="13609" dur="3.949">
create a frame and I&#39;m going to rename this and since I&#39;ve copied that naming convention
</text>
<text start="13612.949" dur="7.04">
in that, in that file, my layer will now be labeled it live under the mobile category
</text>
<text start="13619.989" dur="7.971">
as a one line list, which has a text and action, and it is in line, it&#39;s not stacked.
</text>
<text start="13627.96" dur="2.439">This is stacked. But this is a two line example.</text>
<text start="13630.399" dur="5.54">
As you can see with the tech stack, the text is above those actions.
</text>
<text start="13635.939" dur="3.79">
And what we&#39;re going to need first off is our text button.
</text>
<text start="13639.729" dur="2.541">
So we just type in text, we can find that text button there.
</text>
<text start="13642.27" dur="4.13">
And our assets panel, we can drag that in here, we can go ahead and re name this to
</text>
<text start="13646.4" dur="2.13">
action. And you&#39;ll notice that we already have auto
</text>
<text start="13648.53" dur="2.251">
layout applied to this button. So we&#39;re not to manually resize it, which
</text>
<text start="13650.781" dur="3.958">
is very convenient. And we&#39;ll leave that off to the side for now.
</text>
<text start="13654.739" dur="6.131">
And let&#39;s justify the width here, set that to 360, which adheres to mobile principles
</text>
<text start="13660.87" dur="4.789">
for Android as material design was created for Android in the beginning.
</text>
<text start="13665.659" dur="3.971">
So with that specified, let&#39;s go ahead and specify the height to fit four pixels.
</text>
<text start="13669.63" dur="4.67">
Now that we have the height specified, one thing we will also need later on is the divider.
</text>
<text start="13674.3" dur="3.139">
So if I go in my assets panel and look for the divider that we&#39;ve already created, I
</text>
<text start="13677.439" dur="3.411">
can drag that in here, and we already have the width specified, and it has the proper
</text>
<text start="13680.85" dur="2.98">
color style that we need, I can just remove, I&#39;m gonna go to the main component real quick
</text>
<text start="13683.83" dur="6.36">
and detach this unnecessary turned off textile, fill style, fill color.
</text>
<text start="13690.19" dur="6.249">
And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and publish this. And we&#39;ll be good to go.
</text>
<text start="13696.439" dur="12.29">
Add real variance. So, so now that that&#39;s published, and it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="13708.729" dur="3.731">
successfully published, I can go ahead and update the component here, as you can see,
</text>
<text start="13712.46" dur="5.699">
it&#39;s now updated, doesn&#39;t contain that, that background layer that fill, because it&#39;s unnecessary,
</text>
<text start="13718.159" dur="4.46">
we utilize a stroke here. And we can just go ahead and as you if you
</text>
<text start="13722.619" dur="4.631">
pay attention closely to the designs, you may or may not need this banner, to have a
</text>
<text start="13727.25" dur="4.77">
divider, as you can see, there&#39;s a divider being communicated right there between the
</text>
<text start="13732.02" dur="4.69">
content and the top that bar right there. So just keep that in mind.
</text>
<text start="13736.71" dur="4.6">
And what we can do is we can offer this, and then designers can copy this component and
</text>
<text start="13741.31" dur="3.77">
then turn it off if if need be. So we can offer that.
</text>
<text start="13745.08" dur="3.38">
So I&#39;m gonna, that&#39;s the first thing I&#39;m going to add to all of them, I&#39;ve just snapped that
</text>
<text start="13748.46" dur="6.45">
to the bottom of this frame, by holding down Command S, option s skews me, since that is
</text>
<text start="13754.91" dur="5.3">
a child element of the parent frame, I can easily snap this as needed to the top or the
</text>
<text start="13760.21" dur="1.649">
bottom. So now that I have that set there, I&#39;m gonna
</text>
<text start="13761.859" dur="4.811">
set the constraints are bottom left and right. So that way, if this were to ever be stretched,
</text>
<text start="13766.67" dur="4.63">
that divider will will stretch with. But we have this defined here, and we won&#39;t
</text>
<text start="13771.3" dur="5.97">
really need to, we won&#39;t need to modify that as we are developing the system for Android
</text>
<text start="13777.27" dur="2.629">
in this scenario. So with that said, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and
</text>
<text start="13779.899" dur="5.321">
drag in this button here snapped to the left, and it&#39;s eight pixels from the right and it
</text>
<text start="13785.22" dur="5.96">
is centered vertically on the y axis here. So that is set accordingly.
</text>
<text start="13791.18" dur="5.53">
And then I&#39;m going to add the constraint to the right of the parent frame to the constraint
</text>
<text start="13796.71" dur="3.68">
will stick to the right of its parent frame and then it will be centered vertically.
</text>
<text start="13800.39" dur="4.509">
So whenever it is stretched, it will always stay center in relation to the height either
</text>
<text start="13804.899" dur="5.39">
decreasing or increasing. And then we&#39;ll go ahead and specify the text.
</text>
<text start="13810.289" dur="4.931">
So the text again is using, we&#39;re going to add color style here first text and iconography
</text>
<text start="13815.22" dur="5.269">
and use the high emphasis text color style. And then we&#39;ll go ahead and specify body to
</text>
<text start="13820.489" dur="4.681">
for this typography. And then if we just type in one line, just
</text>
<text start="13825.17" dur="5.899">
mimic what is written there, and that spec one line string with one action websi can&#39;t
</text>
<text start="13831.069" dur="4.41">
type here with one action, we should be good to go.
</text>
<text start="13835.479" dur="3.88">
So with that specified, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and center this here, snap this to the left
</text>
<text start="13839.359" dur="4.08">
with my shortcut key option A and option B to center vertically.
</text>
<text start="13843.439" dur="6.781">
And I&#39;m gonna move this over to 16. So the padding is set to 16 dips, right there,
</text>
<text start="13850.22" dur="3.469">
and that is center. And with that centered, our content is good
</text>
<text start="13853.689" dur="3.54">
to go. And you can see that material design specifies
</text>
<text start="13857.229" dur="6.17">
that the textbox is specifically 30 has a spacing of 36 pixels right here.
</text>
<text start="13863.399" dur="3.771">
So what we can do is we right now it&#39;s set to 48.
</text>
<text start="13867.17" dur="5.3">
From the text button itself, that so we can go ahead and hold down Command and stretch
</text>
<text start="13872.47" dur="6.139">
out that text box to be set to so the spacing is set to 36.
</text>
<text start="13878.609" dur="2.87">
So now it&#39;s set to 36. Here, the spacing we&#39;re going to need to do
</text>
<text start="13881.479" dur="5.92">
to ensure that that is fixed is that we can go ahead with constraints and set this to
</text>
<text start="13887.399" dur="2.5">
left and right. So those constraints are maintained if this
</text>
<text start="13889.899" dur="5.061">
were to ever be stretched, and we don&#39;t necessarily have to worry about that right now.
</text>
<text start="13894.96" dur="4.829">
I&#39;m going to set the typography also to be centered vertically on the y axis so that
</text>
<text start="13899.789" dur="5.49">
is in alignment with the action that is in line to the right of it.
</text>
<text start="13905.279" dur="6.771">
So if designers ever have a need for expanding this, that won&#39;t mess up their designs.
</text>
<text start="13912.05" dur="4.33">
So with that specify we are good to go. I&#39;m not showing you autolab because I will
</text>
<text start="13916.38" dur="4.58">
show you that in the next section of the course, that will that will be its own focus, where
</text>
<text start="13920.96" dur="3.59">
you will master that I really want you to understand the concepts of constraints in
</text>
<text start="13924.55" dur="3.689">
this section of the course. And just the the general construction of these
</text>
<text start="13928.239" dur="5.611">
components, as well as adding autolayout into the mix can can be very taxing confusing,
</text>
<text start="13933.85" dur="2.96">
on top of all of this dense knowledge you&#39;re learning currently.
</text>
<text start="13936.81" dur="6.099">
So with this, all with the typography all specified and attached to their proper color
</text>
<text start="13942.909" dur="4.881">
styles and everything utilizing instances, we now need to go into the background of this
</text>
<text start="13947.79" dur="5.539">
frame and specify the color. So the color is utilizing is the surface background,
</text>
<text start="13953.329" dur="6.071">
we can specify that as surface surface or surface background there was that that to
</text>
<text start="13959.4" dur="6.579">
surface surface surfaces surface, there we go, as that as the surface that is overlaid
</text>
<text start="13965.979" dur="5.471">
on top of the background, it&#39;s not the initial background for the entire page, it&#39;s just
</text>
<text start="13971.45" dur="6.779">
the the surface for that for that banner component. So now that we&#39;ve created this, we&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="13978.229" dur="6.651">
to go ahead and duplicate it. And then we&#39;re gonna make this a component.
</text>
<text start="13984.88" dur="4.54">
So a main component, now we have our main component, we have our first parent created.
</text>
<text start="13989.42" dur="7.34">
And let&#39;s go ahead and build out the this two line variant with actions.
</text>
<text start="13996.76" dur="11.069">
So one thing to note is that we have to probably modify the line height of our text elements,
</text>
<text start="14007.829" dur="4.2">
because in the beginning when I created these textiles in our system, which I did intentionally
</text>
<text start="14012.029" dur="6.431">
for us to modify, and pay attention to, to the line height of our typography, to ensure
</text>
<text start="14018.46" dur="4.619">
that it&#39;s done correctly, because if it&#39;s not done correctly, the spacing of our typography
</text>
<text start="14023.079" dur="4.181">
will be off in in components that are to line variants and whatnot.
</text>
<text start="14027.26" dur="6.95">
So let&#39;s go ahead and create when I move this screenshot over, create a new one.
</text>
<text start="14034.21" dur="6.189">
So I&#39;m going to go ahead and copy this, that naming convention.
</text>
<text start="14040.399" dur="7.17">
And when it grab, I&#39;m going to create this from scratch a new frame, set to a width of
</text>
<text start="14047.569" dur="6.571">
360 and a height of 112. Then I&#39;m gonna paste in the naming convention,
</text>
<text start="14054.14" dur="7.2">
we have the mobile version of the two line with text and actions, banner variant, which
</text>
<text start="14061.34" dur="5.979">
is great. And now this uses a textile body to but I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="14067.319" dur="6.901">
going to go ahead and copy this, this action button, paste it and hold down Option s, option
</text>
<text start="14074.22" dur="6.099">
D, and that&#39;ll snap to the bottom and right and then move that up until the padding is
</text>
<text start="14080.319" dur="2.21">set to eight on the bottom. And right.</text>
<text start="14082.529" dur="4.931">
Now I&#39;m going to duplicate this and ensure that padding is set to eight there to the
</text>
<text start="14087.46" dur="4.609">
right from that element. And we have both of these elements here sticking
</text>
<text start="14092.069" dur="3.851">
to the right. And we want them to stick to the bottom as
</text>
<text start="14095.92" dur="3.71">
well of this component. So if it were ever to be stretched out, it
</text>
<text start="14099.63" dur="9.08">
would stick to that bottom and right spacing respectively respective of its parent, which
</text>
<text start="14108.71" dur="2.839">
is the background. And while we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s go ahead and
</text>
<text start="14111.549" dur="4.591">
change the fill to surfaces surface that background color.
</text>
<text start="14116.14" dur="5.24">
And now we got to go in and just justify the proper spacing for how our typography will
</text>
<text start="14121.38" dur="3.79">
fit. So I&#39;m gonna create this text box here, select
</text>
<text start="14125.17" dur="5.17">
the body to color style. And then I&#39;m going to just kind of mimic what
</text>
<text start="14130.34" dur="6">
is in. In this component, the text in that component.
</text>
<text start="14136.34" dur="6.88">
One to two lines is favorable on mobile, and tablet.
</text>
<text start="14143.22" dur="3.55">Okay, great. So we have the text we need.</text>
<text start="14146.77" dur="5.509">Now we need to kind of specify a couple of things.</text>
<text start="14152.279" dur="4.531">
So what we need to specify is that the baseline of the first line of text in this two line
</text>
<text start="14156.81" dur="7.99">
text is set to 36 dips, and this padding left is set to 16.
</text>
<text start="14164.8" dur="6.229">
As well as the padding on the right is set to we can say 16 here in this scenario.
</text>
<text start="14171.029" dur="4.991">
So let&#39;s go ahead and snap that to the left there, push this content down slightly.
</text>
<text start="14176.02" dur="5.169">
So we got that set to 16. And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and push this over
</text>
<text start="14181.189" dur="6.831">
and sure that that&#39;s set to 16. On the right there, set the constraint to
</text>
<text start="14188.02" dur="5.019">
left and right and the top and bottom. And then we&#39;re going to need to justify the
</text>
<text start="14193.039" dur="6.681">
spacing here between these buttons and the text there, which is where we&#39;ll start to
</text>
<text start="14199.72" dur="5.42">
modify the line height potentially. So let&#39;s go ahead and pull out our rulers
</text>
<text start="14205.14" dur="8.29">
here, shift R, and then I&#39;m going to create a 36 pixel high rectangle to just reference
</text>
<text start="14213.43" dur="5.28">
where the baseline needs to be for this text. So I&#39;m going to push this content down And
</text>
<text start="14218.71" dur="6.789">
essentially, it is right now currently stated that the text box has a padding on the top
</text>
<text start="14225.499" dur="7.811">
of 22 dips to achieve that three, six, dip baseline there from the top.
</text>
<text start="14233.31" dur="13.04">
As you can see, and with that, we can even adjust this text box to ensure that it does
</text>
<text start="14246.35" dur="4.19">
not overlap or interfere with the actions below it.
</text>
<text start="14250.54" dur="6.279">
And it showcases that there&#39;s a spacing of 12 pixels from the baseline to the top of
</text>
<text start="14256.819" dur="2.881">
the button. So let&#39;s go ahead and double check that.
</text>
<text start="14259.7" dur="5.55">
And if that isn&#39;t the case, that is an indication of potentially our line height being off on
</text>
<text start="14265.25" dur="5.54">
the typestyle. So go ahead and create this set that to 12,
</text>
<text start="14270.79" dur="8.449">
we are very close, there was one pixel off the baselines one pixel off.
</text>
<text start="14279.239" dur="4.401">
So essentially what we could do is go into our textile and modify that.
</text>
<text start="14283.64" dur="3.849">
So it&#39;s set to 20. So I go in and modify, go to the definition
</text>
<text start="14287.489" dur="8.061">
style, modify it to 20. And then publish that to my library, publish,
</text>
<text start="14295.55" dur="6.91">
successfully published and then I can update this, once I update it pay attention to the
</text>
<text start="14302.46" dur="5.43">
text here dropping down one pixel, and it actually dropped down more than one pixel.
</text>
<text start="14307.89" dur="8.48">
So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and undo that style. And reference my body to textile, ensure that
</text>
<text start="14316.37" dur="6.909">
that&#39;s there, I&#39;m going to republish that change, and just ensure that that updates
</text>
<text start="14323.279" dur="4.281">
again, so that stays there. And I&#39;m going to live with that just one pixel
</text>
<text start="14327.56" dur="7.25">
off there, although I do think it&#39;s correct. Um, and with that, achieved, look and feel
</text>
<text start="14334.81" dur="8.28">
and you have all the spacing set properly. And that proper color style on the text, with
</text>
<text start="14343.09" dur="4.41">
the high emphasis textile applied, we should be good to go.
</text>
<text start="14347.5" dur="6.739">
So all like I can even hide my rulers or just remove them specifically from this layer,
</text>
<text start="14354.239" dur="7.322">
one thing we are missing is a divider. So I&#39;m going to copy this divider here, and
</text>
<text start="14361.561" dur="4.718">
then paste it and then hit option s and that will snap to the bottom of this element.
</text>
<text start="14366.279" dur="6.651">
And it has this has the constraints from the previous component we built.
</text>
<text start="14372.93" dur="3.02">
And then once I&#39;ve built that out, we can test the constraints there.
</text>
<text start="14375.95" dur="3.1">
And you&#39;ll notice that the constraints are maintained and that spacing when I stretch
</text>
<text start="14379.05" dur="4.59">
out this element, and the divider sticks to where it needs to be.
</text>
<text start="14383.64" dur="4">
And once I&#39;m satisfied with the responsiveness of this component, I am good to go.
</text>
<text start="14387.64" dur="7.88">
If you want to really be clear, concise, you can create the reordered the the elements
</text>
<text start="14395.52" dur="7.03">
in your component, which is a great thing to do is that will be easier to consume the
</text>
<text start="14402.55" dur="3.19">
components. And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and make this a, we
</text>
<text start="14405.74" dur="4.44">
can make that a master component, I&#39;m going to duplicate it and pause this video and build
</text>
<text start="14410.18" dur="9.95">
out the the third variant for the mobile version. So what you can do is modify this as needed,
</text>
<text start="14420.13" dur="6.189">
you can drag in a placeholder icon. So we can type in placeholder.
</text>
<text start="14426.319" dur="3.771">
And we have that placeholder. And we can round out the edges.
</text>
<text start="14430.09" dur="4.53">
So you could now that we have that round icon, and you have a you know a head start there,
</text>
<text start="14434.62" dur="3.699">and a clue. So I&#39;ll be right back.</text>
<text start="14438.319" dur="3.88">
Now created that third variant, I just had to increase the height to 120.
</text>
<text start="14442.199" dur="9.311">
Add in that 40 by 40 dip icon, set that padding perspective in relation to what is indicated
</text>
<text start="14451.51" dur="7.34">
in the spec here. And I kind of just it was very simple and
</text>
<text start="14458.85" dur="3">
straightforward. Nothing, nothing difficult there, I just ensure
</text>
<text start="14461.85" dur="4.66">
I have those right constraints set. And I and you should be good to go.
</text>
<text start="14466.51" dur="4.85">
And with that said, I&#39;m going to go ahead and make this a main component.
</text>
<text start="14471.36" dur="4.48">
And we&#39;re going to go ahead and create the desktop version.
</text>
<text start="14475.84" dur="7.72">
So with this one line variant here, we can go ahead and specify the height and I just
</text>
<text start="14483.56" dur="4.75">
duplicated, this first version that we created on mobile because it&#39;s essentially the same
</text>
<text start="14488.31" dur="2.95">
exact thing. But for desktop, the width is specified at
</text>
<text start="14491.26" dur="3.48">
a much larger, it&#39;s much larger the width there.
</text>
<text start="14494.74" dur="6.909">
And what we can do is set that width to 720. Now, and the nice thing about this is our
</text>
<text start="14501.649" dur="4.131">
constraints will adapt accordingly. So still have that spacing there needed.
</text>
<text start="14505.78" dur="7.089">
So the texts can fill up a good majority of this message here, and we have the divider
</text>
<text start="14512.869" dur="6.99">
there for designers to utilize if need be to really make that message Such distinct.
</text>
<text start="14519.859" dur="5.5">
And our typography properties stay the same or action still there with the same spacing
</text>
<text start="14525.359" dur="3.061">
on those elements, it&#39;s just that the width is now change.
</text>
<text start="14528.42" dur="5.16">
And I need to change this to the naming convention of this component as well.
</text>
<text start="14533.58" dur="6.649">
So it&#39;s desktop. It&#39;s a one line, text and action in line for
</text>
<text start="14540.229" dur="6.831">
the desktop area, so I can go ahead and just change that to desktop, there&#39;s rename that,
</text>
<text start="14547.06" dur="5.28">
and we are good to go. So with that, go ahead and make that a main
</text>
<text start="14552.34" dur="3.17">
component. And we&#39;ll create the other one from scratch,
</text>
<text start="14555.51" dur="9.179">
here, so we have, we don&#39;t, the width for this three line element looks like it may
</text>
<text start="14564.689" dur="5.491">
be set to 80 pixels, it&#39;s not actually giving me that specified height, we&#39;re just going
</text>
<text start="14570.18" dur="3.219">
to throw them out. So I&#39;m going to reference that documentation
</text>
<text start="14573.399" dur="5.361">
again. Yeah, it&#39;s cut off, it&#39;s hard to read, but
</text>
<text start="14578.76" dur="3.989">
I&#39;m gonna, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s at as that is divisible by eight.
</text>
<text start="14582.749" dur="9.44">
So for this three line list, let&#39;s go ahead and create a new frame.
</text>
<text start="14592.189" dur="5.781">
And click, apply the proper surfaces surface color stuff in the background, I&#39;m gonna go
</text>
<text start="14597.97" dur="8.25">
ahead and grab this naming convention they&#39;re in well organized and publish these components.
</text>
<text start="14606.22" dur="4.84">
So I&#39;ve got that naming convention set. And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and specify the width
</text>
<text start="14611.06" dur="7.04">to 720. And grab a divider, as that will grab up,</text>
<text start="14618.1" dur="3.37">
put up, get all the generic things out of the way, specify that width to 720.
</text>
<text start="14621.47" dur="6.17">
Set the constraints bottom left and right, that just use my shortcut keys to snap it
</text>
<text start="14627.64" dur="7.089">
to the very bottom, as you can see here. And that&#39;s good to go.
</text>
<text start="14634.729" dur="5.3">
And we just need to double check the height here, set that to 80.
</text>
<text start="14640.029" dur="3.011">
And that divider still sticks stays there as need be.
</text>
<text start="14643.04" dur="4.249">
And we can go ahead and add these two actions, get those out of the way.
</text>
<text start="14647.289" dur="6.99">
So I&#39;m going to copy this text button, paste it, snap it to the bottom and right and then
</text>
<text start="14654.279" dur="2.071">
move it up. So the padding on the bottom right set to
</text>
<text start="14656.35" dur="5.21">
eight, duplicate this and ensure that that is eight pixels away from the button to the
</text>
<text start="14661.56" dur="6.35">
right, apply the proper constraints here. And we should be good to go the action buttons.
</text>
<text start="14667.91" dur="4.949">
Now we just needed to find our three line list of our three line text string.
</text>
<text start="14672.859" dur="6.05">
So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and create that select the body to textile.
</text>
<text start="14678.909" dur="3.91">
And what we need, I&#39;m going to go ahead and pause this video, copy this text real quick.
</text>
<text start="14682.819" dur="5.701">
I wrote out the exact word for word, banner message here.
</text>
<text start="14688.52" dur="4.94">
And I use the right textile. And I need to actually hold down Command and
</text>
<text start="14693.46" dur="5.13">
ensure that this textile is wrapping the entirety of this message and then vertically center
</text>
<text start="14698.59" dur="4.109">
it and then check the spacing on the left here set to 24 dips.
</text>
<text start="14702.699" dur="4.571">
So I have 25 right now push that over one dip, and we&#39;re good to go.
</text>
<text start="14707.27" dur="9.69">
And the spacing between here and here. And the and the text box is 90 dips.
</text>
<text start="14716.96" dur="6.13">
So what I can do is stretch this out so that it&#39;s set to 90.
</text>
<text start="14723.09" dur="8.71">
Right now I have 90 to push that over a couple. That&#39;s not what 94 so now I&#39;ve moved that
</text>
<text start="14731.8" dur="3.559">
over, it&#39;s set to 90. Now we have that spacing of 90 between the
</text>
<text start="14735.359" dur="5.281">
text bounding box and the actions which is super important.
</text>
<text start="14740.64" dur="4.62">
So now that we have that we&#39;re good to go, we&#39;ve now defined that.
</text>
<text start="14745.26" dur="5.019">
And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and create this component. And I&#39;m going to challenge you to building
</text>
<text start="14750.279" dur="5.62">
out this last desktop banner message by yourself. So just follow those specs, the height here
</text>
<text start="14755.899" dur="3.491">
says 72, just because that&#39;s cut off into that might be difficult.
</text>
<text start="14759.39" dur="6.62">
And then the baseline of this text here is 20 pixels from the bottom, but just it&#39;s actually
</text>
<text start="14766.01" dur="3.389">
just eight. So same specs as we&#39;ve been doing here for
</text>
<text start="14769.399" dur="3.151">
those actual buttons. Anyways, I&#39;m gonna pause the video and make
</text>
<text start="14772.55" dur="7.33">
this and I hope you enjoyed this exercise. Now created that third desktop variant for
</text>
<text start="14779.88" dur="5.58">
the banner message and we are good to go. So now we have this component that designers
</text>
<text start="14785.46" dur="6.579">
can now go ahead and duplicate and then start replacing the imagery as needed for the icon
</text>
<text start="14792.039" dur="4.541">
placeholder modifying the typography with the proper text bounding box.
</text>
<text start="14796.58" dur="6.25">
Apply specified there for this component and then also the proper placement for these buttons
</text>
<text start="14802.83" dur="3.409">as well to Add and modify the text which is great.</text>
<text start="14806.239" dur="6.981">
Today we&#39;re going to be going over building out the bottom navigation and there are only
</text>
<text start="14813.22" dur="4.83">
two variants on the bottom navigation and it is the portrait version and the landscape.
</text>
<text start="14818.05" dur="5.16">
version for the, we&#39;re going to be designing that for the Android based format.
</text>
<text start="14823.21" dur="3.051">
And we have the resource to the documentation, so you can open up that link.
</text>
<text start="14826.261" dur="6.358">
And if we go ahead and click on it, clearly at the bottom navigation allows movement between
</text>
<text start="14832.619" dur="5.731">
primary destinations and an application. This is crucial and very common.
</text>
<text start="14838.35" dur="4.36">
And it&#39;s used in every application, whether you&#39;re using Facebook mobile on your phone,
</text>
<text start="14842.71" dur="5.619">
whether it&#39;s iOS, or Android, or you&#39;re using YouTube, or you&#39;re using some sort of Google
</text>
<text start="14848.329" dur="5.101">
application within the Google suite. And I highly recommend you just reading through
</text>
<text start="14853.43" dur="4.21">
all the contents, just like every other video to really understand in depth what these components
</text>
<text start="14857.64" dur="5.589">
do everything associated with those elements, and also the research behind that.
</text>
<text start="14863.229" dur="3.691">
And also understanding the states and how you interact with this.
</text>
<text start="14866.92" dur="3.399">
So in figma, I&#39;ve taken screenshots of the specs.
</text>
<text start="14870.319" dur="4.8">
And one thing to note that&#39;s very important is that the minimum width of the container
</text>
<text start="14875.119" dur="8.761">
for each button is set to 80 dips, and the maximum width is set to 168 dips in width.
</text>
<text start="14883.88" dur="8.21">
So you&#39;ll notice that they&#39;re both utilizing the the minimum width specified here, 80,
</text>
<text start="14892.09" dur="3.33">
dips wide. And on the portrait version, portrait being
</text>
<text start="14895.42" dur="7.439">
if we create a frame, and I go ahead and select Android, I now have my android version.
</text>
<text start="14902.859" dur="2.43">
So I&#39;m just going to type in, I&#39;m going to label this properly.
</text>
<text start="14905.289" dur="6.551">
So I&#39;m going to go ahead and type in bottom navigation space slash base, portrait.
</text>
<text start="14911.84" dur="8.8">
Once you&#39;ve labeled that properly, I&#39;m going to also duplicate that and set this type in
</text>
<text start="14920.64" dur="7.5">
landscape. And once you specify landscape now that landscapes,
</text>
<text start="14928.14" dur="3.83">
this is landscape, so we&#39;re gonna design for landscape here.
</text>
<text start="14931.97" dur="8.269">
And we&#39;re gonna go ahead and start by kicking off this party by specifying the height of
</text>
<text start="14940.239" dur="9.141">
this set to 56 pixels, and it has this bottom app bar the elevation in the diagram, you
</text>
<text start="14949.38" dur="5.109">
can look at it yourself to verify if you don&#39;t believe me, but the elevation by default set
</text>
<text start="14954.489" dur="5.24">
to eight dips. So what you&#39;ll notice is that say I had another
</text>
<text start="14959.729" dur="7.72">
frame here, and I detach that, and I just went and re specified that this was the material
</text>
<text start="14967.449" dur="8.191">
design sized frame. And I went ahead and just Android just labeled
</text>
<text start="14975.64" dur="5.49">
that Android portrait. And you&#39;ll notice that this is the bottom
</text>
<text start="14981.13" dur="4.7">
navigation set to portrait here, and that the content is clipped.
</text>
<text start="14985.83" dur="4.72">
Now because the parent frame has that checked, you won&#39;t see the drop shadow on the other
</text>
<text start="14990.55" dur="2.09">sides. So now we need to go ahead and start adding</text>
<text start="14992.64" dur="5.25">
in the content. So what do we have we have these three icons
</text>
<text start="14997.89" dur="5.689">
here, but those will live inside a specific containers.
</text>
<text start="15003.579" dur="9.91">
So these icons are set to 24 dips wide and in height and are centered on the axis here.
</text>
<text start="15013.489" dur="10.441">
So if I go ahead and select these three, I can go ahead and ensure that these are horizontally
</text>
<text start="15023.93" dur="7.939">
centered, and then space them accordingly. And what you can do to ensure that is that
</text>
<text start="15031.869" dur="6.66">
it&#39;s it&#39;s centered within 120 pixel frame 120 dip wide frame.
</text>
<text start="15038.529" dur="8.361">
So what we can do if you&#39;re confused, is, since this is 363 60 divided by three is 120
</text>
<text start="15046.89" dur="5.29">dips. So all we have to do is wrap a frame around</text>
<text start="15052.18" dur="7.62">
each of these icons, set the width to 120 and the height to 56.
</text>
<text start="15059.8" dur="5.229">
And what we want to do is I hit option W and a to snap it to the top and left.
</text>
<text start="15065.029" dur="5.141">
And then if I hit Enter, and hit option V and H it will center that perfectly on the
</text>
<text start="15070.17" dur="5.269">
screen. And then we can do the same exact thing for
</text>
<text start="15075.439" dur="3.941">
this one as well. So I can actually detach that now that it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="15079.38" dur="6.369">
centered, it&#39;s positioned with padding of 48 to the left and vertically on the y axis.
</text>
<text start="15085.749" dur="6.051">
So all we got to do is wrap this in a frame, set that to 120 pixels wide, and the height
</text>
<text start="15091.8" dur="3.59">
to 56. I&#39;m going to hit option w so the snaps to
</text>
<text start="15095.39" dur="7.79">
the top, and then I&#39;m going to act going to horizontally center this and then hit enter
</text>
<text start="15103.18" dur="3.7">
and hit option D and H to center that within this frame.
</text>
<text start="15106.88" dur="5.909">
So you&#39;ll notice that this is 120 pixels wide and so is the section to the left of it.
</text>
<text start="15112.789" dur="10.811">
And what we can do is now that that&#39;s centered it I can ungroup that frame.
</text>
<text start="15123.6" dur="5.589">
And I could even apply just the spacing here, just to double check.
</text>
<text start="15129.189" dur="3.5">
Or I could wrap this in a frame. Again, if you&#39;re not that confident want to
</text>
<text start="15132.689" dur="5.96">
be extremely precise, set the width to 120, the height to 56, and then hit option D, so
</text>
<text start="15138.649" dur="3.521">
the snaps to the left hand, option W, so it snaps to the top of the parent frame that
</text>
<text start="15142.17" dur="3.47">
I&#39;m going to enter. Now I have my icon selected, hit option D,
</text>
<text start="15145.64" dur="4.13">
and then H. Now that is centered within the 120 dips wide
</text>
<text start="15149.77" dur="3.4">frame, and is 48 pixels away from the next icon.</text>
<text start="15153.17" dur="4.609">
And I can ungroup that now my Layers panel, and now everything is centered accordingly.
</text>
<text start="15157.779" dur="4.111">
So now I have my icons properly centered in the bottom navigation.
</text>
<text start="15161.89" dur="3.979">
So one thing we&#39;re missing, of course, is this typography.
</text>
<text start="15165.869" dur="3.66">
So we can go ahead and reference the documentation once more.
</text>
<text start="15169.529" dur="5.981">
And it shows you that this type, we can check the typography in the theming.
</text>
<text start="15175.51" dur="8.389">
And it uses the caption style. So with that caption being used, the the baseline
</text>
<text start="15183.899" dur="6.031">
is 12 dips away from the bottom of the icon frame, which is a great thing for us to reference.
</text>
<text start="15189.93" dur="8.899">
So if we go ahead and now create a textile, I&#39;m going to go ahead and create this textile
</text>
<text start="15198.829" dur="7.91">
and label that whoops. I&#39;m just going to type in featured set that
</text>
<text start="15206.739" dur="6.26">resizing to auto width, apply the textile caption.</text>
<text start="15212.999" dur="7.7">
And ensure the fill is set to on primary and ensure that is in all caps.
</text>
<text start="15220.699" dur="2.571">
And I&#39;m going to double check whoops, it&#39;s not all caps.
</text>
<text start="15223.27" dur="5.32">
And I wrote the wrong thing, excuse me, it&#39;s labeled favorites done should be paying attention
</text>
<text start="15228.59" dur="2.359">
here. And essentially what I&#39;m gonna do is with
</text>
<text start="15230.949" dur="8.101">
this line height set. With this baseline, I&#39;m going to just center
</text>
<text start="15239.05" dur="4.54">
this in the center of this by moving it you&#39;ll see that it snaps gives me that red arrow
</text>
<text start="15243.59" dur="6.67">
indication, I&#39;m going to move this up and see I have this red line here that I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="15250.26" dur="5.069">
to apply to the bottom of the frame. And I need the baseline to be set to 12 pixels
</text>
<text start="15255.329" dur="7.13">
right now. It&#39;s set to a 11 on the baseline or our baseline
</text>
<text start="15262.459" dur="3.101">
set to 11. So if we need to push that down one pixel,
</text>
<text start="15265.56" dur="5.979">
which leaves a pixel gap on the top of the icons, outer bounding box.
</text>
<text start="15271.539" dur="5.7">
So now we have the baseline set to 12. So that is fantastic.
</text>
<text start="15277.239" dur="7.611">
And we can also reference a given hour, our typography here, what we&#39;re going to need
</text>
<text start="15284.85" dur="7.229">
to do is actually select this icon. And we can go ahead and group this and then
</text>
<text start="15292.079" dur="6.041">
I can hold option v. and this will actually center that content.
</text>
<text start="15298.12" dur="3.96">
And then I&#39;m going to ungroup it again. And what I want to do is make sure that this
</text>
<text start="15302.08" dur="3.37">a lot, the alignment of the text is at the center.</text>
<text start="15305.45" dur="4.839">
So whenever a user renames it, it just is automatically centered in that component.
</text>
<text start="15310.289" dur="5.881">
So they don&#39;t have to deal with messing with alignment and whatnot, that could be very
</text>
<text start="15316.17" dur="5.68">
irritating. So now that that is specified, we are good
</text>
<text start="15321.85" dur="5.25">
to go. And you&#39;ll notice that when the text is applied,
</text>
<text start="15327.1" dur="4.69">
it pushes up the icon. And the icons that aren&#39;t currently active
</text>
<text start="15331.79" dur="6.449">
stay vertical, vertically centered on the axis with that text being applied, takes that
</text>
<text start="15338.239" dur="4.91">
into consideration and calculates it, and then centers that vertically with icon plus
</text>
<text start="15343.149" dur="4.951">text. So now that we have that variant created,</text>
<text start="15348.1" dur="5.009">
we can go ahead and just create that as a main component.
</text>
<text start="15353.109" dur="6.261">
Now we have a our landscape or portrait main component.
</text>
<text start="15359.37" dur="9.529">
So we can go ahead and actually duplicate this, throw this into our landscape variant,
</text>
<text start="15368.899" dur="5.75">
I&#39;m going to rename this to landscape and detach this instance with the shortcut key
</text>
<text start="15374.649" dur="6.621">
option command B. And what we can do is ensure that we have
</text>
<text start="15381.27" dur="6.089">
proper constraints applied to this. So with this example, it&#39;s utilizing the entire
</text>
<text start="15387.359" dur="6.701">
width of the landscape version of the Android phone here in the six frame in this example.
</text>
<text start="15394.06" dur="5.139">
So what we can do is manually ensure that this is correctly being applied.
</text>
<text start="15399.199" dur="10.401">
And by doing that, we need to make sure that these we have three boxes set to 168 dips
</text>
<text start="15409.6" dur="5">
wide or if you have some other better way of calculating it.
</text>
<text start="15414.6" dur="3.23">Please do so. As this is the best way.</text>
<text start="15417.83" dur="3.159">
I know Everything&#39;s vertically centered, as you can see, but what I&#39;m gonna do is the
</text>
<text start="15420.989" dur="7.901">
same approach we do with the portrait version. So I&#39;m gonna set the width to 168 dips for
</text>
<text start="15428.89" dur="9.29">
the height 256 and snap that to the top and to the right, and select my icon, hold that
</text>
<text start="15438.18" dur="4.849">
option v h, make sure that&#39;s centered. So we have this implemented correctly, I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="15443.029" dur="9.68">
going to do the same exact thing for for this next one, and I&#39;m going to separate the top
</text>
<text start="15452.709" dur="8.16">
and horizontally align it to the center. So now, I just need to do that with the icon
</text>
<text start="15460.869" dur="3.041">
as well. Now that that&#39;s applied, we can say we want
</text>
<text start="15463.91" dur="6.039">
to snap this, we want the edges of each of these frames to snap next to each other, because
</text>
<text start="15469.949" dur="12.49">
it&#39;s centered within the middle of this within the middle of this landscape variant, doing
</text>
<text start="15482.439" dur="8.161">
the same exact thing. Tree applying these values, I&#39;m going to make
</text>
<text start="15490.6" dur="6.679">
sure that this text and his favorites and icon are grouped as well, and center that
</text>
<text start="15497.279" dur="4.781">
within this frame. And then I&#39;m going to snap this to the top,
</text>
<text start="15502.06" dur="3.9">
and then push this over until it snaps to see that red line.
</text>
<text start="15505.96" dur="7.569">
Now I have all three elements aligned accordingly. And I can go ahead and ungroup these properties
</text>
<text start="15513.529" dur="3.471">
as needed. So I&#39;m going to ungroup those frames.
</text>
<text start="15517" dur="4.689">
So just utilize this to measure this perfectly or properly.
</text>
<text start="15521.689" dur="9.54">
And with that said, we now have all of this aligned properly, and we are good to go.
</text>
<text start="15531.229" dur="7.161">
All we need to do is ensure that we make this a main component.
</text>
<text start="15538.39" dur="5.259">
So that is our main component. And now all we want to do is go ahead we can
</text>
<text start="15543.649" dur="4.781">
even throw this frame in here is an example of each format.
</text>
<text start="15548.43" dur="7.83">
Or you could just actually, we just want to go ahead and throw this in there as is.
</text>
<text start="15556.26" dur="4.5">
Today, we&#39;re going to be talking about how to build out components.
</text>
<text start="15560.76" dur="5.09">
And it&#39;s going to be real simple, we&#39;re going to start off by in this file going to our
</text>
<text start="15565.85" dur="4.559">
team library, you can hold down Option three. And turning on that library, the library you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="15570.409" dur="4.58">
going to want to access is labeled as material design system, ignore the one that is enabled
</text>
<text start="15574.989" dur="4.731">
above labeled material design, we want the material design system.
</text>
<text start="15579.72" dur="2.69">
And I&#39;m just going to turn that off so you do not get confused.
</text>
<text start="15582.41" dur="4.14">
So now that we have this library enabled, it will have materializes some library unable
</text>
<text start="15586.55" dur="5.46">
to access in our assets panel. And the first thing we&#39;re going to see is
</text>
<text start="15592.01" dur="4.469">
you can go ahead and click on the documentation here, this is a link in figma.
</text>
<text start="15596.479" dur="6.17">
So you can go ahead and open up the the component page on material designs website to understand
</text>
<text start="15602.649" dur="4.271">
what this component actually does. There&#39;s a lot of in depth information here
</text>
<text start="15606.92" dur="5.569">
that I totally recommend you consuming as this will only benefit you as a designer.
</text>
<text start="15612.489" dur="3.42">
And you&#39;ll notice that we have this interactive floating action button that we&#39;re actually
</text>
<text start="15615.909" dur="3.391">
going to be building out ourselves. There&#39;s a default version, and there&#39;s a mini
</text>
<text start="15619.3" dur="6.139">
version set to 40 dips, the default set to 56 dips, and it&#39;s 56 dips in width and height
</text>
<text start="15625.439" dur="3.691">
as well as the mini ones set to 40 dips in width and height as well.
</text>
<text start="15629.13" dur="6.71">
And then we have an extended variant of this floating action button that either comes with
</text>
<text start="15635.84" dur="3.619">
or without an icon. And we&#39;re going to be creating the majority
</text>
<text start="15639.459" dur="3.041">
of these components today. And what I did was I grabbed the screenshots
</text>
<text start="15642.5" dur="2.6">
from the specs. And this tells you actually how to construct
</text>
<text start="15645.1" dur="3.45">
these in figma. And we&#39;ll turn them into main components to
</text>
<text start="15648.55" dur="3.689">
then publish into our library. And it talks about placement.
</text>
<text start="15652.239" dur="3.561">
And again, this is really important, because this will definitely teach you how to differentiate
</text>
<text start="15655.8" dur="2.689">
certain types of buttons as we create several types of buttons.
</text>
<text start="15658.489" dur="4.88">
And this is only one set of those buttons. These are a floating action button.
</text>
<text start="15663.369" dur="5.561">
And as you can see, there are variants of this, we have one two, the leading and text
</text>
<text start="15668.93" dur="3.49">
variant. And then we have two variants of the regular
</text>
<text start="15672.42" dur="5.119">
floating action buttons. So we have a total of four variants there.
</text>
<text start="15677.539" dur="4.261">
And now, you can view this as you wish to refer to.
</text>
<text start="15681.8" dur="2.99">
And we&#39;re gonna go ahead and check our figma file.
</text>
<text start="15684.79" dur="3.77">
And I have this exercise file set up with the screenshots for us to reference.
</text>
<text start="15688.56" dur="4.12">
And the first thing we&#39;re going to need now that we&#39;ve been able to library is the icon.
</text>
<text start="15692.68" dur="5.259">
So that is a plus icon. So if I type in plus, maybe we can just click
</text>
<text start="15697.939" dur="5.55">
on that and continue to search for that icon. And if it&#39;s not appearing in your assets panel,
</text>
<text start="15703.489" dur="6.22">
you could also just extend all of the icons here and you can search by category as well.
</text>
<text start="15709.709" dur="6.08">
If this is just too overwhelming for you, you&#39;ll notice that I&#39;m slowly showing you
</text>
<text start="15715.789" dur="5.331">
this to show Guess the functionality. And again, we can keep searching through this
</text>
<text start="15721.12" dur="4.43">
if we want. But again, this is actually very tedious and
</text>
<text start="15725.55" dur="3.699">
not good for our design process. So the best way to go about this is directly
</text>
<text start="15729.249" dur="2.681">going to the file where all these components live.</text>
<text start="15731.93" dur="3.299">
So you can go ahead and drag any of those components into your canvas.
</text>
<text start="15735.229" dur="4.59">
And if you drag that in, you could then go click on Go to main component, and that&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="15739.819" dur="3.16">
take you directly toward those master components live.
</text>
<text start="15742.979" dur="5.59">
And since all of our components live in the same location, we&#39;re going to go ahead and
</text>
<text start="15748.569" dur="4.861">
search for it ourselves. This, we&#39;re going to look for that plus icon,
</text>
<text start="15753.43" dur="8.23">
and it should live under our action category. I know even here, it may be difficult to parse
</text>
<text start="15761.66" dur="4.489">
and find. So I&#39;m going to pause and look for this real
</text>
<text start="15766.149" dur="3.89">
quick. Since I can&#39;t find this icon, it&#39;s actually
</text>
<text start="15770.039" dur="4.341">
not in our library. And again, this is our library where I intentionally
</text>
<text start="15774.38" dur="3.33">
didn&#39;t put all the icons here, although over time it will.
</text>
<text start="15777.71" dur="3.72">
And I did that because I actually want us to utilize the icon tool.
</text>
<text start="15781.43" dur="5.809">
So I&#39;m going to type in online on the internet Material Design icons tool.
</text>
<text start="15787.239" dur="4.471">
And basically, this tool is a resource to download specific icons that we need.
</text>
<text start="15791.71" dur="4.96">
And we can also search for categories, like I had discussed in the previous video.
</text>
<text start="15796.67" dur="5.239">
And we can either look for it by scrolling through, although that may be difficult, or
</text>
<text start="15801.909" dur="3.28">
I can filter it by the name and I can just type in plus.
</text>
<text start="15805.189" dur="4.651">
And you&#39;ll notice that under the actions category, these are all the plus variants of the icon.
</text>
<text start="15809.84" dur="3.96">
So I kept I typed in plus. And what I was actually looking for was the
</text>
<text start="15813.8" dur="4.001">
Add icon. So if I can double check by going back to
</text>
<text start="15817.801" dur="6.159">
my library, and searching for add, and my icons, and you&#39;ll notice that it is there,
</text>
<text start="15823.96" dur="3.33">
it was just difficult for me to find as this is all very dense.
</text>
<text start="15827.29" dur="3.609">
Oh, there it is. Let me see, sometimes you can get overwhelmed
</text>
<text start="15830.899" dur="3">by that content. So I can go ahead and copy this.</text>
<text start="15833.899" dur="5.321">
And it&#39;s called content add. And I&#39;ll go ahead and search that as an example
</text>
<text start="15839.22" dur="5.029">
content. And if I type in slash add, it will even further
</text>
<text start="15844.249" dur="3.751">
compartmentalize that. And again, we&#39;re good to go, I can drag this
</text>
<text start="15848" dur="5.39">
onto the canvas, I now have the proper dimensions for this icon, I&#39;m just double checking that
</text>
<text start="15853.39" dur="4.219">
the width and height of this icon is set to 24 by 24.
</text>
<text start="15857.609" dur="4.12">
dips in this case. So you see that that&#39;s specified here in the
</text>
<text start="15861.729" dur="4.38">
Properties panel. And all of these variants of the floating
</text>
<text start="15866.109" dur="7.26">
action button, all use a width of 24 by 24, width and height of 24 dips.
</text>
<text start="15873.369" dur="5.151">
I&#39;m here for the icon. And we&#39;re going to go ahead and create the
</text>
<text start="15878.52" dur="4.24">
regular variant first. So what we&#39;re gonna do is, now that we have
</text>
<text start="15882.76" dur="4.179">
this icon, I&#39;m actually going to hold down Option Command G to create a frame.
</text>
<text start="15886.939" dur="8.611">
And we&#39;re going to label this buttons, slash space slash space, floating action.
</text>
<text start="15895.55" dur="9.83">
Whoops, action button, regular. This is the regular variant of the floating
</text>
<text start="15905.38" dur="3.239">
action button. And it lives under the category of buttons
</text>
<text start="15908.619" dur="4.591">
and under the category floating action button, and it is the regular variant.
</text>
<text start="15913.21" dur="4.75">
So that is important to note that we get that naming convention set from the get go, it&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="15917.96" dur="2.55">
make our lives a lot easier. And you&#39;ll know what I mean when we start
</text>
<text start="15920.51" dur="6.189">
to publish these components to the library. And Okay, so now what I want to do is hold
</text>
<text start="15926.699" dur="4.66">
an option, imagine you turn this into a frame again, well, this is the frame.
</text>
<text start="15931.359" dur="9.651">
And what I&#39;m going to do is hold down Shift Option as I drag on the frame and ensure that
</text>
<text start="15941.01" dur="3.75">
that&#39;s set to 56 by 56. And if not, if you don&#39;t want to do it that
</text>
<text start="15944.76" dur="3.319">
way, this is much quicker, you just set these to 56 by 56.
</text>
<text start="15948.079" dur="2.78">
You&#39;ll notice that the icon set to top and left.
</text>
<text start="15950.859" dur="4.241">
By default, as I scale that out, what I&#39;m going to do is in the Layers panel, click
</text>
<text start="15955.1" dur="5.439">
on that icon, hold down Option V and then H and that will center my icon perfectly as
</text>
<text start="15960.539" dur="4.7">
needed for my floating action button in order to create that.
</text>
<text start="15965.239" dur="4.031">
So now that I&#39;ve created that, you&#39;ll notice that the spacing on the left and the right
</text>
<text start="15969.27" dur="5.209">
of the icon should be set to 16. So the padding should be set to 16 dips on
</text>
<text start="15974.479" dur="4.35">
the left and right which it is on this frame. And it might be hard for you to see because
</text>
<text start="15978.829" dur="6.601">
by default that that fill was off turned off and I&#39;m holding down option to get these breadline
</text>
<text start="15985.43" dur="2.719">
measurements. So you&#39;ll see that those specs are set properly.
</text>
<text start="15988.149" dur="4.34">
And it is already vertically centered and horizontally centered as needed.
</text>
<text start="15992.489" dur="3.681">
The frame size is correct. And what I do need to do before I forget is
</text>
<text start="15996.17" dur="8.369">
ensure that the color of this icon is going to turn off that build icon and the selection
</text>
<text start="16004.539" dur="5.471">
color, which is the color applied to the icon here needs to be set properly.
</text>
<text start="16010.01" dur="8.25">
So it needs to be set to content on primary. And you can&#39;t see it right now but that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="16018.26" dur="2.449">
fine. Because we&#39;re going to specify the background
</text>
<text start="16020.709" dur="4.681">
color of this fill by clicking style, going to our content.
</text>
<text start="16025.39" dur="9.479">
And then we&#39;re going to select on should be on background or on surface.
</text>
<text start="16034.869" dur="4.591">
They&#39;re all the same color value. And again, if there&#39;s ever any confusion on
</text>
<text start="16039.46" dur="9.34">
what color to apply, we can always reference the documentation here and in material design,
</text>
<text start="16048.8" dur="3.55">
to understand the behavior better and get clues or hints on how to better construct
</text>
<text start="16052.35" dur="3.809">
these elements. But now that I know what that is, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="16056.159" dur="4.41">to ensure that this component has rounded corners.</text>
<text start="16060.569" dur="5.75">
So I&#39;m going to change the corner radius here and round that out.
</text>
<text start="16066.319" dur="7.071">
You&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s now rounded out when I set this to 32 dips 32 on the corner radius,
</text>
<text start="16073.39" dur="6.62">
I now have my rounded circle. And we have the desired colors applied.
</text>
<text start="16080.01" dur="5.729">
And with this icon implemented as well, I, the last thing I need to do is add an effect
</text>
<text start="16085.739" dur="5.12">
style to this button. And remember, when we worked on elevation,
</text>
<text start="16090.859" dur="5.37">
and I created a diagram of the elevation, one thing we can do is reference documentation
</text>
<text start="16096.229" dur="3.67">
again, and go to elevation on the material design website.
</text>
<text start="16099.899" dur="8.13">
If we go to our components, or if we go to design, and we select the environment and
</text>
<text start="16108.029" dur="8.42">
select elevation, and we go to elevation hierarchy, or whoops, that&#39;s what&#39;s a default depicting
</text>
<text start="16116.449" dur="4.471">
elevation, I&#39;m trying to find the good example of elevation and where it lies on a floating
</text>
<text start="16120.92" dur="3.43">action button. So a floating action button.</text>
<text start="16124.35" dur="7.03">
Let&#39;s find the example here. Okay, so here we have, it&#39;s right here.
</text>
<text start="16131.38" dur="6.88">
So you see this floating action button right here, the floating action button lies on when
</text>
<text start="16138.26" dur="8.029">
it raises to 12 dips in elevation. And you&#39;ll notice that it lives in between
</text>
<text start="16146.289" dur="7.95">
four and eight dips on this axis here. And it lives on the six dips on the y axis.
</text>
<text start="16154.239" dur="3.611">
So that&#39;s where the floating action button is at by default.
</text>
<text start="16157.85" dur="7.41">
So if we go ahead and actually go to our styles, go to effects and apply the six dip, which
</text>
<text start="16165.26" dur="4.9">
is it&#39;s already labeled to in a color system in the description, which is awesome, we have
</text>
<text start="16170.16" dur="4.43">
now created our floating our regular floating action button.
</text>
<text start="16174.59" dur="4.979">
And once you&#39;ve created the desired component as needed, we can go ahead and turn this into
</text>
<text start="16179.569" dur="2.771">
a main component. And you can either click the Create component
</text>
<text start="16182.34" dur="4.08">
in the toolbar right there in the center. But the I always use the shortcut key to create
</text>
<text start="16186.42" dur="1.85">a main component and that&#39;s option command K.</text>
<text start="16188.27" dur="3.889">
If you pay attention your Layers panel, once I hit that shortcut key, I will now have a
</text>
<text start="16192.159" dur="4.631">main component. So that is awesome.</text>
<text start="16196.79" dur="7.5">
And what we need now is a mini floating action button, which is the which is what&#39;s FA B
</text>
<text start="16204.29" dur="4.34">
stands for, and all we actually have to do is we can go ahead and duplicate this, because
</text>
<text start="16208.63" dur="6.43">
essentially what this is, is a smaller version of the regular, it&#39;s just shrink shrunk down.
</text>
<text start="16215.06" dur="3.51">
And what we are going to need to do is detach this element, I&#39;m going to do option command
</text>
<text start="16218.57" dur="5.629">
B, I&#39;m not attached that is a regular frame, or you can right click and click detach instance,
</text>
<text start="16224.199" dur="3.83">
which detaches it from the main component. And what we&#39;ll need to do is now specify the
</text>
<text start="16228.029" dur="2.891">
spacing and tighten it. So you&#39;ll notice that the padding all around
</text>
<text start="16230.92" dur="4.89">
is set to 16 dips. And all you have to do is set the height and
</text>
<text start="16235.81" dur="5.24">
width of this to 40 dips here as specified in the specs, I can go ahead and hit this
</text>
<text start="16241.05" dur="4.199">
constraint proportions, type in 40. And it will do that and what I can do is select
</text>
<text start="16245.249" dur="5.41">
the icon hit option V and then option H, I just hold down Option then hit D then H and
</text>
<text start="16250.659" dur="5.001">
then it will automatically center that in the within the parent frame.
</text>
<text start="16255.66" dur="6.159">
So everything is now set to eight dips on the top, left, bottom and right specified
</text>
<text start="16261.819" dur="2.96">here. And we&#39;re good to go.</text>
<text start="16264.779" dur="3.63">
The only thing we need to do is actually go ahead and rename this and we&#39;re going to call
</text>
<text start="16268.409" dur="4.361">
it the mini fab instead of regular. So we don&#39;t have to change the naming convention
</text>
<text start="16272.77" dur="5.349">
to the left of this layer, just the rightmost portion of it, which is regular.
</text>
<text start="16278.119" dur="5.95">
So change that to mini fHb. You can once you&#39;ve done that, you can turn
</text>
<text start="16284.069" dur="5.79">
this into a master component, right click Create component or main component, I apologize.
</text>
<text start="16289.859" dur="2.83">
And now we have those two variants. Great, we&#39;re good to go.
</text>
<text start="16292.689" dur="5.281">
And the next step is we&#39;re going to need to create another button and it&#39;s an extended
</text>
<text start="16297.97" dur="3.779">
floating action button. And this is our last element that we&#39;ll need
</text>
<text start="16301.749" dur="5.431">
to create here. And with this created, we&#39;re going to go ahead
</text>
<text start="16307.18" dur="6.66">
and reference this mini bind. I&#39;m going to duplicate this button and I&#39;m
</text>
<text start="16313.84" dur="6.819">
going to detach it, detach this instance. And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and set the name convention.
</text>
<text start="16320.659" dur="5.45">
And it&#39;s a long one. So I&#39;m going to type in x dented FA B.
</text>
<text start="16326.109" dur="5.04">
So extended floating action button. Now that we have that name properly, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="16331.149" dur="5.6">
to go ahead and ensure that we specify the parent frame, we&#39;re going to utilize the parent
</text>
<text start="16336.749" dur="5.94">
frame to set the parameters of the button. So all I did was I grabbed the right edge,
</text>
<text start="16342.689" dur="8.47">
held down command and stretched out this element. And I need to make sure that I have my constraints
</text>
<text start="16351.159" dur="6.511">
set properly, maybe I want my constraints to center on the y axis.
</text>
<text start="16357.67" dur="5.46">
So if I didn&#39;t center this, it set the top and left on constraints, this would just stick
</text>
<text start="16363.13" dur="2.149">
there. And I don&#39;t want that because I need to set
</text>
<text start="16365.279" dur="3.971">
this height to 48. And I still need this icon to be aligned centered
</text>
<text start="16369.25" dur="5.71">
vertically, I could just apply that property, go ahead and change the height to 48.
</text>
<text start="16374.96" dur="4.229">
And that stays centered, you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s what sets what pixels on the top and
</text>
<text start="16379.189" dur="4.02">
bottom proportionately. And you can see how powerful utilizing the
</text>
<text start="16383.209" dur="4.801">
principles material design is specified. Things will always be divisible by four or
</text>
<text start="16388.01" dur="3.131">eight. And now that I have that height specified,</text>
<text start="16391.141" dur="4.099">
I need to set the spacing to 12 instead of eight on the left.
</text>
<text start="16395.24" dur="4.151">
So now I have that set to 12. So that spacing is now proportionate.
</text>
<text start="16399.391" dur="4.32">
And I actually need to create some text. And we have the color style already, because
</text>
<text start="16403.711" dur="2.719">we enabled our library for the button color style.</text>
<text start="16406.43" dur="5.07">
And I&#39;m going to specify, I&#39;m going to create some text here, hit t on my keyboard, create
</text>
<text start="16411.5" dur="3.51">
the text tool. And I&#39;m going to type into create.
</text>
<text start="16415.01" dur="4.82">
And I&#39;m going to ensure that I have the content, color style set properly.
</text>
<text start="16419.83" dur="5.231">
So I have content on primary. So on primary, you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s using
</text>
<text start="16425.061" dur="5.209">
the Roboto mano, so does not look like this textile yet, but we need to apply a style.
</text>
<text start="16430.27" dur="4.111">
So with that text selected, I can click on the textiles icon.
</text>
<text start="16434.381" dur="4.67">
And then go ahead and select button. And I now have create set.
</text>
<text start="16439.051" dur="11.791">
And with that created, I can go ahead and so one sec, once that&#39;s specified, I can go
</text>
<text start="16450.842" dur="9.779">
ahead and and specify what I&#39;m going to need to do with this color style is ensure that
</text>
<text start="16460.621" dur="5.971">
I&#39;m holding down command and grabbing the the edge of this text here.
</text>
<text start="16466.592" dur="4.328">
And I can go ahead and center this. So option v to vertically center this, my
</text>
<text start="16470.92" dur="3.922">
spacing set to 12 here and I need the spacing on the right to be set to 20.
</text>
<text start="16474.842" dur="5.748">
Because that that is what specified, the text is centered as it&#39;s pointing here, through
</text>
<text start="16480.59" dur="5.74">
the content being the icon and the text is centered in this floating action button that
</text>
<text start="16486.33" dur="4.541">is extended. And I&#39;ve now centered that here.</text>
<text start="16490.871" dur="6.149">
And we need to set the spacing to 20 here, so I can go ahead and click on this, I can
</text>
<text start="16497.02" dur="5.021">
hold down Option here, which will allow me to see the spacing and I hold down Command
</text>
<text start="16502.041" dur="4.619">
and push this to the left to see if I&#39;m getting the right spacing, I was off by one pixel.
</text>
<text start="16506.66" dur="5.231">
So now it&#39;s set to 20 there. And I have now created the extended floating
</text>
<text start="16511.891" dur="6.359">
action button with all the proper properties. So we can go ahead and double check that by
</text>
<text start="16518.25" dur="4.33">
just pulling this next to it. And what we can see is that we have the icon
</text>
<text start="16522.58" dur="5.18">
set to 24 by 24 dips as specified here, the spacing set to the 12 on the left and right
</text>
<text start="16527.76" dur="5.201">
of the left of the edge of the button and the right of the text.
</text>
<text start="16532.961" dur="3.99">
And it&#39;s vertically centered. And the height of the button itself is set
</text>
<text start="16536.951" dur="3.67">
to 48 dips. And the text has padding to the left set to
</text>
<text start="16540.621" dur="3.359">
12 and spacing of padding to the right set to 20 dips.
</text>
<text start="16543.98" dur="6.452">
And we&#39;re good to go. That is our floating button floating action.
</text>
<text start="16550.432" dur="4.298">
Floating extended floating action button sorry, a lot of words that are going on confusing
</text>
<text start="16554.73" dur="3.231">
myself. So I&#39;m going to create that as a main component.
</text>
<text start="16557.961" dur="5.609">
And one thing you&#39;ll notice is that if I type into this component, I don&#39;t have essentially
</text>
<text start="16563.57" dur="5.43">
what I need, which is auto layout, because it will automatically adapt what I type and
</text>
<text start="16569" dur="2.672">implement the proper spacing as needed as I type.</text>
<text start="16571.672" dur="3.828">
So what we&#39;re going to do is turn this into an auto layout component.
</text>
<text start="16575.5" dur="5.99">
And the next section of the course will will go over specifically auto layout for implementing
</text>
<text start="16581.49" dur="4.43">
these components, which needs to be covered separately, I believe, because it&#39;s a lot
</text>
<text start="16585.92" dur="5.301">
of content to consume. And understanding, providing the nomenclature
</text>
<text start="16591.221" dur="4.869">
here for this component by layering it accordingly naming it in the Layers panel accordingly.
</text>
<text start="16596.09" dur="4.111">
And then also utilizing the tips and tricks to create the components themselves may take
</text>
<text start="16600.201" dur="2.6">
some time. So we&#39;re going to specifically focus on that
</text>
<text start="16602.801" dur="5.92">
and constraints as needed. So I&#39;m going to actually center this and ensure
</text>
<text start="16608.721" dur="7.781">
that this sticks to the left and right but again, remember that when we finalize publishing
</text>
<text start="16616.502" dur="2.258">
these components, we&#39;re going to Use auto layout.
</text>
<text start="16618.76" dur="4.301">
And we won&#39;t be using these constraints are solely using constraints for the practice
</text>
<text start="16623.061" dur="3.65">
of understanding constraints, which you&#39;ll be masters at once we build out all these
</text>
<text start="16626.711" dur="4.66">
components interactively together. So that is all I have.
</text>
<text start="16631.371" dur="3.869">
The last thing is organizing and publishing this so.
</text>
<text start="16635.24" dur="5.85">
So now that we have all of this organized and published, well, now we need to organize
</text>
<text start="16641.09" dur="5.951">
it since we have these main components. So what we can do is, with this regular floating
</text>
<text start="16647.041" dur="6.42">
action button here, we can go ahead and specify that make sure it&#39;s aligned accordingly, we
</text>
<text start="16653.461" dur="8.76">
can change, excuse me, the spacing as needed. Whoops, I&#39;m going to go ahead and drag this
</text>
<text start="16662.221" dur="3.24">over here. Got that set to 16.</text>
<text start="16665.461" dur="6.961">
spacing between the types set to 72. And I&#39;m going to go ahead and drag this one
</text>
<text start="16672.422" dur="5.289">
last button here and change this make sure that&#39;s set to 16.
</text>
<text start="16677.711" dur="6.379">
And we now have our three button variants here for the floating action buttons, as directed
</text>
<text start="16684.09" dur="4.349">
here from the specs specified on the material design website.
</text>
<text start="16688.439" dur="5.961">
So that is what we just created. And you can go ahead and read the contents
</text>
<text start="16694.4" dur="3.19">
of this web page, which is accessible in our exercise file right here at the bottom, you
</text>
<text start="16697.59" dur="4.09">
just click on that link, select Open link. And it&#39;ll open that page for you.
</text>
<text start="16701.68" dur="4.711">
And you&#39;ll be good to go. And again, I&#39;m going to keep this here short
</text>
<text start="16706.391" dur="2.379">and sweet. Thank you so much for watching.</text>
<text start="16708.77" dur="6.06">
In the other videos, you&#39;ll notice that we&#39;ll actually publish these in the, to our material
</text>
<text start="16714.83" dur="5.17">
design system file as a whole. But I&#39;m going to save that for the end.
</text>
<text start="16720" dur="5.93">
So we can do that all together in one go. So that way, you&#39;re not your heads, not context
</text>
<text start="16725.93" dur="5.422">
switching between the types, the two separate processes, which is building out these components,
</text>
<text start="16731.352" dur="7.449">
and then organizing and publishing the components. Today, we&#39;re gonna be talking about building
</text>
<text start="16738.801" dur="4.791">
just some generic buttons. And if you click on the link here in our resources,
</text>
<text start="16743.592" dur="5.219">
we can go ahead and access the buttons documentation, I totally recommend going through all this
</text>
<text start="16748.811" dur="4.349">
in depth, but we&#39;re primarily going to be mostly focusing on constructing these buttons.
</text>
<text start="16753.16" dur="4.291">
And what you&#39;ll notice is that we also have another interactive field here, nice little
</text>
<text start="16757.451" dur="3.08">
playground for us to see what we&#39;re going to be building.
</text>
<text start="16760.531" dur="4">
And also we&#39;re going to be talking about, we got the different variants.
</text>
<text start="16764.531" dur="4.649">
Here, we got the contained button, we got the outline button, and we got the text button.
</text>
<text start="16769.18" dur="3.591">And all of these buttons also have a leading icon.</text>
<text start="16772.771" dur="5.741">
So they all have that type as well. So we have three, three regular variants.
</text>
<text start="16778.512" dur="4.35">
So we&#39;re going to create well there. And then we also have each of these variants
</text>
<text start="16782.862" dur="2.348">
with a leading icon. So we&#39;re going to be creating six types of
</text>
<text start="16785.21" dur="3.09">
buttons today. And as you can see, they&#39;re also states associated
</text>
<text start="16788.3" dur="4.132">
with that, which we&#39;ll cover later in the different section of the course.
</text>
<text start="16792.432" dur="6.08">
And what we can do is just, we have all of the specs here.
</text>
<text start="16798.512" dur="4.25">
So we can go ahead and check specs to see the dimensions of how to actually construct
</text>
<text start="16802.762" dur="3.638">
these buttons. And one screen Yep, I got all the screenshots
</text>
<text start="16806.4" dur="4.74">
here, got all five variants. And note that all of these variants have one
</text>
<text start="16811.14" dur="4.32">
with a leading icon, which will take into consideration, which is why we check the documentation.
</text>
<text start="16815.46" dur="4.312">As you can see here, they also have leading icons.</text>
<text start="16819.772" dur="4.09">
So I can go ahead and just screenshot this as well if I wanted to.
</text>
<text start="16823.862" dur="5.98">
And I can go ahead and paste this to my canvas, and click on each type and just screenshot
</text>
<text start="16829.842" dur="3.52">all these and for all of you Mac users out there.</text>
<text start="16833.362" dur="5.34">
If you hold down Ctrl Shift command for it will allow you to take a quick screenshot
</text>
<text start="16838.702" dur="4.468">
of your interface, and then you can paste it into the canvas and figma.
</text>
<text start="16843.17" dur="3.622">
And now I have all those variants. And we&#39;re gonna go ahead and start with the
</text>
<text start="16846.792" dur="3.32">
contained button. And since auto layout was super easy to implement
</text>
<text start="16850.112" dur="2.888">
with these buttons, we&#39;ll go ahead and cover this.
</text>
<text start="16853" dur="6.58">
But auto layout will be its own section of the course as well as creating these, these
</text>
<text start="16859.58" dur="4.292">
creating these components with just the sole understanding of how to construct them and
</text>
<text start="16863.872" dur="4.219">
utilize the color styles and whatnot is time consuming in and of itself is why there is
</text>
<text start="16868.091" dur="5.469">
a another section in the course for just auto layout and adding auto layout to these components
</text>
<text start="16873.56" dur="5.452">
we&#39;re currently building. So now we can start with a generic frame.
</text>
<text start="16879.012" dur="5.44">
I&#39;m gonna go ahead and hit that. So the frame has a height of 36 dips.
</text>
<text start="16884.452" dur="5.06">
So I&#39;ll change that to 36. And now that we have the height set to 36
</text>
<text start="16889.512" dur="4.6">
steps, I&#39;m going to go ahead and make sure that the on primary background colors specified
</text>
<text start="16894.112" dur="4.598">
if we go to effects and go to fill, hit the style icon.
</text>
<text start="16898.71" dur="3.92">
And one thing we need to do that I forgot is that since these are individual exercise
</text>
<text start="16902.63" dur="4.84">
files, we&#39;ll have to re enable the library and we need to re enable the material design
</text>
<text start="16907.47" dur="4.21">
system library to access those color styles. So now that we have that specified, I can
</text>
<text start="16911.68" dur="4.772">
go to my Phil and I have that library here viewable material design system.
</text>
<text start="16916.452" dur="5.938">
And I&#39;m going to go ahead and click On the primary color, which is the color of background
</text>
<text start="16922.39" dur="7.29">
color button, and again, we&#39;re going to need to double check the corner radius of this
</text>
<text start="16929.68" dur="3.692">
button, I can go, there&#39;s a few ways you could actually do this.
</text>
<text start="16933.372" dur="4.528">
And the border radius, I just checked the code, the border radius is set to four pixels
</text>
<text start="16937.9" dur="2.632">
there. So I can go ahead and change the corner radius
</text>
<text start="16940.532" dur="5.518">
here to four pixels. Now that that&#39;s set, you&#39;ll notice that we
</text>
<text start="16946.05" dur="5.93">
need to add some text to this, once we add the text will adjust the width of this component.
</text>
<text start="16951.98" dur="6.58">
So if I type in, apply the proper color style, go to content, and then select content on
</text>
<text start="16958.56" dur="3.83">
primary which is content from the on the primary surface.
</text>
<text start="16962.39" dur="7.34">
So if I type in button, or apply the proper color style, I mean textile, select the button
</text>
<text start="16969.73" dur="6.98">
textile, I now have button. And one thing I noticed with this style is
</text>
<text start="16976.71" dur="7.2">
that we had the click on the type Details button and to ensure that auto width is selected
</text>
<text start="16983.91" dur="4.66">
for the resizing, which is what we want. And one thing I can do is hold down Option
</text>
<text start="16988.57" dur="2.73">
V and H which will center this horizontally and vertically.
</text>
<text start="16991.3" dur="3.41">
But this won&#39;t really matter once we add auto layout.
</text>
<text start="16994.71" dur="5.662">
So that&#39;s just a trick I frequently use to center items within the parent frame, horizontally
</text>
<text start="17000.372" dur="4.58">
vertically, which is Option A v. So now that we have the coast selected for
</text>
<text start="17004.952" dur="3.728">
both the background and the text, I can go ahead and add auto layout.
</text>
<text start="17008.68" dur="3.65">
So how do you do that? Well, I don&#39;t know it needs to be applied to both elements.
</text>
<text start="17012.33" dur="5.32">
And what are those both? What are the two elements I&#39;m referring to? Well, the two elements
</text>
<text start="17017.65" dur="9.552">
are the the text layer here and this frame, and I&#39;m going to name this buttons.
</text>
<text start="17027.202" dur="4.708">
Space slash space, and then label this contained button because this is our contained button.
</text>
<text start="17031.91" dur="4.94">
And now that I have that properly labeled, I&#39;m going to hit shift a, what that just did
</text>
<text start="17036.85" dur="6.022">
is that that just added auto layout. And what I&#39;m going to want to do is that by
</text>
<text start="17042.872" dur="5.74">
default, auto layout ads, horizontal and vertical padding by default, and we don&#39;t want that
</text>
<text start="17048.612" dur="3.93">
because we want this to stay vertically centered. So I just hit option B again to vertically
</text>
<text start="17052.542" dur="6.838">
center it, and then ensure that this auto layout set to horizontal.
</text>
<text start="17059.38" dur="3.96">
And then I&#39;m going to select the parent layer and add auto layout to that as well.
</text>
<text start="17063.34" dur="4.25">
And I just hit shift a to do that. Or you notice that you can click on this frame,
</text>
<text start="17067.59" dur="4.612">
right click and select Add auto layout, or you can do it from the canvas as well.
</text>
<text start="17072.202" dur="2.758">
I click on that right click and select Add auto layout.
</text>
<text start="17074.96" dur="4.52">
And you&#39;ll notice that we have this set to vertical.
</text>
<text start="17079.48" dur="13.151">
So what does vertical do if I type it it&#39;s some just the vertical parameter allows you
</text>
<text start="17092.631" dur="6.491">
to resize this vertically. Whereas if I set this horizontally, I would
</text>
<text start="17099.122" dur="9.018">
be changing the I would be resizing this horizontally, I mean vertically, sorry for the confusion
</text>
<text start="17108.14" dur="4.27">
there. So if I set this auto out to vertical, you&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="17112.41" dur="4.97">
notice that I&#39;m only able to actually resize the width on the horizontal axis.
</text>
<text start="17117.38" dur="6.902">
And if I select horizontal, I&#39;m actually only able to specify modifying the heights.
</text>
<text start="17124.282" dur="2.948">
But that doesn&#39;t matter. We already have our height specified.
</text>
<text start="17127.23" dur="6.03">
And recognize that and apply the proper vertical padding so that it was consistent and with
</text>
<text start="17133.26" dur="5.172">
the text there, so the Texas center. And now all I need to do is ensure that the
</text>
<text start="17138.432" dur="5.19">
padding horizontal padding is not set to 162, which it is, as you can see there.
</text>
<text start="17143.622" dur="3.298">
And it&#39;s set to 16. So I got to just change that to 16.
</text>
<text start="17146.92" dur="3.06">
Now what does autolayout do, I have this button now.
</text>
<text start="17149.98" dur="8.222">
And if I use this button, if I type hello and just keep typing, it automatically adjusts
</text>
<text start="17158.202" dur="2.34">
the padding. So that&#39;s what we need, it&#39;ll save you a lot
</text>
<text start="17160.542" dur="4.608">
of time as as the designer, it&#39;s a very helpful feature.
</text>
<text start="17165.15" dur="3.68">
So with that created, the only thing missing if you pay attention closely, there is some
</text>
<text start="17168.83" dur="6.212">
elevation data these buttons, and we can go ahead and reference material design documentation
</text>
<text start="17175.042" dur="5.128">
once more. And what we need to do is go ahead and access
</text>
<text start="17180.17" dur="7.242">
the environment, good elevation, and click on depicting elevation to scroll down a bit.
</text>
<text start="17187.412" dur="6.38">
And we&#39;re going to go ahead and look for this diagram.
</text>
<text start="17193.792" dur="5.298">
And what you&#39;ll see is that we need to find our buttons and our contained button lives
</text>
<text start="17199.09" dur="7.73">
on the two dips axis for the elevation, and when it is pressed, it rises to the eight
</text>
<text start="17206.82" dur="7.75">
dips, or eight pixels and the elevation axis. So we can go ahead and apply the two dips
</text>
<text start="17214.57" dur="3.16">
effect style, which is right here. Got the two dip set.
</text>
<text start="17217.73" dur="2.44">There. So now we have the proper elevation set for</text>
<text start="17220.17" dur="3.282">
this button. And we are good to go with this button.
</text>
<text start="17223.452" dur="5.698">
And we can go ahead and even create this as a main component.
</text>
<text start="17229.15" dur="4.892">
Now we have this main component set. Now we can create the other main component,
</text>
<text start="17234.042" dur="3.958">which is a contained button with a leading icon.</text>
<text start="17238" dur="3.73">
And you&#39;ll notice that this icon is set to 18 by 18 pixels.
</text>
<text start="17241.73" dur="7.65">
But we can also double check for go to our buttons, click on leading icon, we can inspect
</text>
<text start="17249.38" dur="10.79">
the code received in command, shift C, to view this button, I can break this down and
</text>
<text start="17260.17" dur="5.282">
try to view the specs of this button. But if it&#39;s too hard for you, then don&#39;t do
</text>
<text start="17265.452" dur="2.808">
it. But that&#39;s one way of looking at those specs.
</text>
<text start="17268.26" dur="4.24">
But we already have that already. So I hope I didn&#39;t confuse you, just providing
</text>
<text start="17272.5" dur="7.792">
some technical tips and tricks on how to analyze things if you are suspicious of them not being
</text>
<text start="17280.292" dur="4.83">
done properly. So I&#39;ve now removed the auto layout and the
</text>
<text start="17285.122" dur="8.388">
detached the instance. So I can go ahead and resize this component
</text>
<text start="17293.51" dur="2.62">
accordingly. So I need eight pixels in between my icon
</text>
<text start="17296.13" dur="4.38">
and the text. So what I can do is actually use constraints
</text>
<text start="17300.51" dur="5.75">
here, set that to right, and center on the vertical axis right on the horizontal.
</text>
<text start="17306.26" dur="5.112">
And I can stretch this out, and it will maintain that proper spacing on the right to 16.
</text>
<text start="17311.372" dur="4.768">
And it&#39;s still centered, and it gives me some room to add in the new icon.
</text>
<text start="17316.14" dur="2.71">And all we actually need is a placeholder icon.</text>
<text start="17318.85" dur="4.45">
So we can go ahead and click on our assets. You could literally type whatever you want,
</text>
<text start="17323.3" dur="5.962">
I just typed in star. It can be anything like it could be the Add
</text>
<text start="17329.262" dur="5.308">
button, like we did in the floating Actions button.
</text>
<text start="17334.57" dur="5.39">
And what we can do is one remove this fill layer because it&#39;s inactive, there&#39;s no purpose
</text>
<text start="17339.96" dur="2.04">for that. So that&#39;s just confusing.</text>
<text start="17342" dur="3.542">And we can click on content and select on primary.</text>
<text start="17345.542" dur="5.548">
And if it&#39;s going to be on our on primary color style surface, that background.
</text>
<text start="17351.09" dur="4.97">
And now, what we had to do is scale this down to 18.
</text>
<text start="17356.06" dur="5.77">
By 18, all I did was I held Option Shift, which will proportionately scale this down
</text>
<text start="17361.83" dur="9.47">
as I drag the handles downward, I can plop this into my layer and ensure that this is
</text>
<text start="17371.3" dur="2.46">vertically aligned by holding down Option v.</text>
<text start="17373.76" dur="2.71">
Since I know this isn&#39;t it&#39;s in the parent frame.
</text>
<text start="17376.47" dur="4.392">
And just double check the spacing set to 12 dips there.
</text>
<text start="17380.862" dur="5.16">
So now I can go ahead and move that over one pixel.
</text>
<text start="17386.022" dur="3.658">
And what I could do is turn this into an auto layout as well.
</text>
<text start="17389.68" dur="7.05">
And the parent frame into an auto layout. And we can start to specify the spacing between
</text>
<text start="17396.73" dur="10.36">
items. So what we can do here is remove that initial
</text>
<text start="17407.09" dur="4.93">
padding set by auto layout always adds one extra pixel horizontal and vertically, which
</text>
<text start="17412.02" dur="10.89">
is annoying. And we want to make sure this is set to 12
</text>
<text start="17422.91" dur="8.122">
on the left. This might be tricky with auto layout, because
</text>
<text start="17431.032" dur="7.898">
it&#39;s not allowing us to specify each edge on on this layout here.
</text>
<text start="17438.93" dur="4.55">
So that can be tricky. And again, we can cover that in the next video.
</text>
<text start="17443.48" dur="3.802">
If this is too hard for you. What I&#39;m going to do actually, since we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="17447.282" dur="5.738">
only focused on the construction of this component, and not autolayout is just disregard that
</text>
<text start="17453.02" dur="3.04">
so we get the specs perfect. And we can focus on that in the next section
</text>
<text start="17456.06" dur="3.43">of the course. So we have that set of 12.</text>
<text start="17459.49" dur="3.48">
And I&#39;m gonna move this over, make sure it&#39;s set to eight.
</text>
<text start="17462.97" dur="8.26">
And make sure the padding to the right of this button is set to 16.
</text>
<text start="17471.23" dur="6.73">
So now that that&#39;s set to 16, and in the parent frame is set to eight from the right and left
</text>
<text start="17477.96" dur="4.832">
12 on the left. This button has been constructed properly.
</text>
<text start="17482.792" dur="9.258">
So once that&#39;s constructed properly, I&#39;m going to just imply that this is a contained button
</text>
<text start="17492.05" dur="8.5">
with an icon. So what we can do is specify that right there
</text>
<text start="17500.55" dur="4.41">
contain button with icon and make that a main component.
</text>
<text start="17504.96" dur="6.38">
Now we have two components here specified. And we&#39;re going to go ahead and create the
</text>
<text start="17511.34" dur="5.55">
outline version of both of these. So I&#39;m actually going to save us some time
</text>
<text start="17516.89" dur="8.05">
duplicate these two Once these two are duplicated, we know that these don&#39;t use elevation, so
</text>
<text start="17524.94" dur="3.62">
we can remove that. And what we&#39;re gonna do is hold down Option
</text>
<text start="17528.56" dur="5.042">
command B, which will detach those styles. And notice one of them has auto layout, which
</text>
<text start="17533.602" dur="3.698">
is this one. So I&#39;m going to hit Option Shift a to detach
</text>
<text start="17537.3" dur="4.08">
that from auto layout. So it&#39;s just a frame, which is what we want.
</text>
<text start="17541.38" dur="9.482">
We know that the heights are set properly. And what we need is an outline of a border
</text>
<text start="17550.862" dur="10.308">
around this button. So if I go ahead and type in, outlined button,
</text>
<text start="17561.17" dur="10.99">
I&#39;m going to go ahead, do the same thing for this one.
</text>
<text start="17572.16" dur="8.202">
And I just specify the spacing on this, make sure it&#39;s set to 16, I should be good to go,
</text>
<text start="17580.362" dur="7.708">
all we had to really do is modify the color and add a stroke.
</text>
<text start="17588.07" dur="8.31">
So with that said, One thing to double check is the height on this button, the height has
</text>
<text start="17596.38" dur="1.912">
been modified. So I&#39;m going to change that to 36.
</text>
<text start="17598.292" dur="4.47">
Again, to make sure that this content is still centered.
</text>
<text start="17602.762" dur="5.498">
So that&#39;s one thing we should always look out for as we&#39;re building these elements is
</text>
<text start="17608.26" dur="3.942">
making sure that they&#39;re they&#39;re centered accordingly.
</text>
<text start="17612.202" dur="8.238">
And as we implement these things, so I&#39;m gonna ungroup that there that shouldn&#39;t be grouped,
</text>
<text start="17620.44" dur="7.07">
that should definitely be centered on our canvas, still set to eight, everything, this,
</text>
<text start="17627.51" dur="2.942">
this button has a frame because we add an auto layout.
</text>
<text start="17630.452" dur="4.59">
So when I detach those things I forgot to add to remove this frame.
</text>
<text start="17635.042" dur="4.66">
So that&#39;s why that occurred. So now it&#39;s ensuring that pixels are perfect
</text>
<text start="17639.702" dur="3.028">there. So we&#39;re good to go.</text>
<text start="17642.73" dur="5.94">
And now I can go ahead and remove the bill style from both of these.
</text>
<text start="17648.67" dur="4.112">
And what we&#39;re going to want to do is add a stroke and leave it at one pixel.
</text>
<text start="17652.782" dur="8.478">
And for the color of this, we need to go ahead and actually view this outline button.
</text>
<text start="17661.26" dur="6.982">
And you&#39;ll notice that the outline button is set to the on primary colors.
</text>
<text start="17668.242" dur="6.498">
But in the specs, we we have a different color specified, but that&#39;s alright, so for the
</text>
<text start="17674.74" dur="5.31">
sole purpose of constructing these elements, we&#39;ll leave that outline to the on primary
</text>
<text start="17680.05" dur="4.75">
color, although that may not be the case at all times.
</text>
<text start="17684.8" dur="6.562">
So we go ahead and click on the stroke, go to the style, select on primary, and we&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="17691.362" dur="5.98">
go and double check this button and the color style is set to on primary as well.
</text>
<text start="17697.342" dur="6.628">
So I can Command click on that text and Command Shift click on the second set of text, and
</text>
<text start="17703.97" dur="4.99">then go ahead and select on primary color style.</text>
<text start="17708.96" dur="9.38">
And I can do the same thing with this leading icon here, ensure that it&#39;s set to on primer
</text>
<text start="17718.34" dur="7.1">
as opposed to on surface. So now we have those two button variants and
</text>
<text start="17725.44" dur="3.702">
just ensure that the spacing set to 16. And it&#39;s vertically centered, which it is
</text>
<text start="17729.142" dur="8.608">
by holding down option. And we can go ahead and rename this from contained
</text>
<text start="17737.75" dur="5.69">
button to outline button. And now that we have that we&#39;re good to go.
</text>
<text start="17743.44" dur="5.48">
And we can make that a main component. You&#39;ll notice that this still resizes with
</text>
<text start="17748.92" dur="5.842">
all the proper parameters, which is great. But to make that a main component by holding
</text>
<text start="17754.762" dur="4.968">
an option, command K. And we are good to go with this component
</text>
<text start="17759.73" dur="3.052">
as well. I&#39;m gonna go ahead and hold down Option command
</text>
<text start="17762.782" dur="2.138">K. So we have those two variants.</text>
<text start="17764.92" dur="4.282">
And we only have three more button components to make next.
</text>
<text start="17769.202" dur="3.428">
So we have our contained variants and our outline variants.
</text>
<text start="17772.63" dur="3.04">
So we could even delete that screen. We can&#39;t delete the screenshot.
</text>
<text start="17775.67" dur="5.08">
But now we have our text button. So our button is essentially just text, but
</text>
<text start="17780.75" dur="5.372">
not to confuse you. For those of you questioning why we shouldn&#39;t
</text>
<text start="17786.122" dur="4.608">
just use text for this button. Well, when you utilize the states of this
</text>
<text start="17790.73" dur="4.78">
button, like when you hover on this button, it actually has some parameters around it.
</text>
<text start="17795.51" dur="5.46">
So that&#39;s why we need to make this that&#39;s why this isn&#39;t just a actual text button.
</text>
<text start="17800.97" dur="3.702">It actually has transparent parameters around it.</text>
<text start="17804.672" dur="3.808">
So when you hover on it, those colors appear and you can see that it&#39;s actually encapsulated
</text>
<text start="17808.48" dur="6.44">
in a rectangle. So if we go back to figma we can create that
</text>
<text start="17814.92" dur="2.65">
variant and I&#39;m just going to duplicate this button here.
</text>
<text start="17817.57" dur="4.422">
No need to worry created from scratch that&#39;ll make your lives harder, no need to make your
</text>
<text start="17821.992" dur="6.238">
life harder or work smarter, not harder. And then we&#39;ll detach the style because it
</text>
<text start="17828.23" dur="6.78">
doesn&#39;t utilize elevation, and will actually just remove the back the fill color, which
</text>
<text start="17835.01" dur="5.25">
is the background and will Command click on the text and set that text to on primary color
</text>
<text start="17840.26" dur="2.46">
style. And we now have our text button, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="17842.72" dur="6.822">
to label that as text button. And the only difference is, we need to change
</text>
<text start="17849.542" dur="6.348">
the auto layout horizontal padding from 16 to eight, because there&#39;s less padding, so
</text>
<text start="17855.89" dur="3.41">
if we click on this, it&#39;s set to eight on the left and right the horizontal padding,
</text>
<text start="17859.3" dur="4.3">
and the text is centered vertically, and the height of this is set to 36.
</text>
<text start="17863.6" dur="6.72">
And the mid the minimum width of a button in terms of its width can be set to 64 pixels.
</text>
<text start="17870.32" dur="6.372">
So this would it work a button labeled A so because the minimum width of it as specified
</text>
<text start="17876.692" dur="4.978">
in the documentation is needs to have a min width of 64 bits, which is just 64 pixels.
</text>
<text start="17881.67" dur="4.9">
In this scenario, we have one set to 100 tendons, so we&#39;re good to go.
</text>
<text start="17886.57" dur="6">
And that is the construction out of our our text button.
</text>
<text start="17892.57" dur="3.792">
And what I&#39;m going to do is I need to actually detach this.
</text>
<text start="17896.362" dur="7.488">
And I&#39;m going to rename it text button. So we have text button, I&#39;m going to option
</text>
<text start="17903.85" dur="3.28">
command K to make that a main component. And we are good to go.
</text>
<text start="17907.13" dur="4.8">
only thing missing is another text button with a leading icon.
</text>
<text start="17911.93" dur="3.13">
As you can see here is a text button with a leading icon.
</text>
<text start="17915.06" dur="6.542">
So what I can do is duplicate this button here, this outline button with a leading icon,
</text>
<text start="17921.602" dur="5.618">
leading meaning that it&#39;s in front of the text here in terms of left to write.
</text>
<text start="17927.22" dur="6.482">
And I&#39;m going to detach this instance as it is a part of a different family.
</text>
<text start="17933.702" dur="9.488">
And attach the instance and ensure that the padding is set to eight on the left and right.
</text>
<text start="17943.19" dur="7.39">
Once that&#39;s done, I need to be very careful about my frames here and make sure this is
</text>
<text start="17950.58" dur="3.182">nice and clean. Just ungroup those frames there.</text>
<text start="17953.762" dur="4.418">
So we&#39;re good to go. What I need to do is the padding here set
</text>
<text start="17958.18" dur="4.26">to 12. And that&#39;s set to 16.</text>
<text start="17962.44" dur="4.602">
So I can shrink that down. But we can also reference the code here.
</text>
<text start="17967.042" dur="3.08">
So here, you can clearly see that the padding still set to 12.
</text>
<text start="17970.122" dur="5.318">
I mean eight on the right and left the left of this icon, set eight and right with buttons
</text>
<text start="17975.44" dur="4.65">
at eight. And then it still maintains that spacing in
</text>
<text start="17980.09" dur="7.262">
between the icon and text as you can see. So by just kind of tried to inspect that code
</text>
<text start="17987.352" dur="4.74">
there, it could give me a general idea of the spacing of the elements.
</text>
<text start="17992.092" dur="5.618">
So the padding stayed there. And we&#39;re good to go, let&#39;s, I&#39;m going to
</text>
<text start="17997.71" dur="14.992">
just specify that as text button, gonna shrink by holding down Come in, shrink that to fourth
</text>
<text start="18012.702" dur="7.068">
set to eight. And then this button is set to its proper
</text>
<text start="18019.77" dur="3.121">
parameters. So now that it&#39;s good to go, we just need
</text>
<text start="18022.891" dur="8.779">
to rename it. So it is a text button with icon and make
</text>
<text start="18031.67" dur="2.04">that a main component. And we are good to go.</text>
<text start="18033.71" dur="9.832">
The last buttons we need to create our is this toggle buttons variant.
</text>
<text start="18043.542" dur="9.958">
So with that said, Okay, so now with this toggle button, what we&#39;re going to do is we
</text>
<text start="18053.5" dur="6.17">
have three sections here, these there&#39;s three buttons and this toggle button.
</text>
<text start="18059.67" dur="7.04">
And they&#39;re all boxes set to 48 by 48 dips. And then there&#39;s a stroke in between, we could
</text>
<text start="18066.71" dur="5.77">
call this the stroke and these two strokes here set to one pixel.
</text>
<text start="18072.48" dur="3.7">
And then it also has a border around it as well, which is a stroke.
</text>
<text start="18076.18" dur="1.98">
So we&#39;ll take that into consideration. As we build this.
</text>
<text start="18078.16" dur="5.3">
I&#39;m going to go ahead and create a frame so we can just do the math.
</text>
<text start="18083.46" dur="7.78">
So 48 times three is 144, we can specify that width to 144 and ensure that the height set
</text>
<text start="18091.24" dur="2.94">
to 48. So we have that and make sure the background
</text>
<text start="18094.18" dur="5.65">color of this fill is set to surfaces. surface.</text>
<text start="18099.83" dur="5.292">
And once that&#39;s set to surface, we can go ahead and grab the we can grab placeholder
</text>
<text start="18105.122" dur="3.958">
icons right now we don&#39;t know if you want to get into the specifics and find those.
</text>
<text start="18109.08" dur="6.42">Now we you can by accessing your library of icons.</text>
<text start="18115.5" dur="2.792">
And actually yeah, we can go ahead and do that since it&#39;s free.
</text>
<text start="18118.292" dur="6.108">
easy to find in our library. And we have all of the format&#39;s needed to
</text>
<text start="18124.4" dur="4.292">
select for this example. So I just went into our materials and system
</text>
<text start="18128.692" dur="5.358">
library, which is also enabled here. And I pasted these three, and what I need
</text>
<text start="18134.05" dur="5.95">
to do is add the proper color style. So add remove the fill that&#39;s turned off,
</text>
<text start="18140" dur="4.59">
that&#39;s hidden. And now I can go to surfaces content, and
</text>
<text start="18144.59" dur="7.671">
then on on surface, since the background is set to surface, and they&#39;re already set to
</text>
<text start="18152.261" dur="5.709">
24 by 24. And what I need to do is set the corner radius
</text>
<text start="18157.97" dur="3.55">as well. So generally the core radius set.</text>
<text start="18161.52" dur="5.72">
For this scenario, it&#39;s set to two. And with that set to two, we can go ahead
</text>
<text start="18167.24" dur="7.49">
and plop these in accordingly. So this icon, I&#39;m going to center vertically,
</text>
<text start="18174.73" dur="4.98">
since the heights proper, please set already, it&#39;s just padding is set to 12 pixels from
</text>
<text start="18179.71" dur="7.14">
the left here and 12 pixels from the right of this one pixel stroke here.
</text>
<text start="18186.85" dur="9.852">
And one thing we need to do is add a border. So what we can do is add a stroke and set
</text>
<text start="18196.702" dur="6.138">
that to triple E, hit Enter. And it&#39;s already set to one pixel and we want
</text>
<text start="18202.84" dur="3.1">
it set to inside. Because if we set it to the inside, that is
</text>
<text start="18205.94" dur="7.23">
the proper basting we want or else it&#39;ll set it in, it&#39;ll set it inside the frame, if we
</text>
<text start="18213.17" dur="3.362">
set it to outside the stroke is now outside of our frame.
</text>
<text start="18216.532" dur="3.42">
We want that set to inside since that&#39;s what&#39;s specified here.
</text>
<text start="18219.952" dur="8.138">
Now that set inside, I&#39;m going to create a line that&#39;s one pixel in the hex values Triple
</text>
<text start="18228.09" dur="5.72">
E or six E&#39;s, the x value, then just set that to 48.
</text>
<text start="18233.81" dur="8.371">
And one thing I&#39;m going to do is flatten this by hitting command or Command Shift O, and
</text>
<text start="18242.181" dur="2.659">
then I&#39;m going to hit option W and that will align it.
</text>
<text start="18244.84" dur="3.692">
And then I&#39;m just going to make sure the padding set to 12.
</text>
<text start="18248.532" dur="5.56">
So now this icons got padding on the left and right at 12 and top and bottom.
</text>
<text start="18254.092" dur="7.67">
And we can drag this in here, I can center that vertically, I can go ahead and duplicate
</text>
<text start="18261.762" dur="4.048">this. Make sure that&#39;s set to 12 as well.</text>
<text start="18265.81" dur="4.611">
So now set to 12 on the left and right. And then all we have to do is drag this in
</text>
<text start="18270.421" dur="12.289">
here and make sure it&#39;s set to 12 as well. So now it&#39;s set to 12 on the left.
</text>
<text start="18282.71" dur="7.96">
And right one thing that isn&#39;t correct here is this last icon spacings padding of 10 on
</text>
<text start="18290.67" dur="6.13">
the left, make that 12. And then we can stretch out this button by
</text>
<text start="18296.8" dur="5.34">
holding down command on the right handle, move it out twice.
</text>
<text start="18302.14" dur="5.41">
And now that&#39;s set to 12 proportionately. So now these are all good to go.
</text>
<text start="18307.55" dur="7.58">
What we can do is go ahead and label this properly.
</text>
<text start="18315.13" dur="6.02">
So we can label this if we rename this layer buttons, space slash space, label that toggle
</text>
<text start="18321.15" dur="4.282">buttons. Enter, we are good to go.</text>
<text start="18325.432" dur="5.58">
We can even make this a main component by just hitting option command K, and we are
</text>
<text start="18331.012" dur="5.298">
good to go. And now we have all of our button variants.
</text>
<text start="18336.31" dur="7.76">
Now we can just go ahead and add them into our file as needed.
</text>
<text start="18344.07" dur="6.882">
And that is everything you need to have covered in this course.
</text>
<text start="18350.952" dur="4.488">
Or for this video, excuse me. So now I&#39;m just dragging these.
</text>
<text start="18355.44" dur="2.99">
So I&#39;m gonna pause and organize these now bareback.
</text>
<text start="18358.43" dur="3.87">
So now I have all of these organized in my buttons layer.
</text>
<text start="18362.3" dur="6.83">
And they&#39;re named accordingly. Today we&#39;re going to be going over building
</text>
<text start="18369.13" dur="3.69">
card components. And and we&#39;re going to get an overview and
</text>
<text start="18372.82" dur="6.2">
understanding of the usage for the usage and need for cards, when to use them and how to
</text>
<text start="18379.02" dur="2.96">
build these cards out utilizing the components we&#39;ve already made.
</text>
<text start="18381.98" dur="5.632">
So we can go ahead and start off by opening up our team library modal here, and we need
</text>
<text start="18387.612" dur="5.848">
to turn on our material design system. And then we have access to the cars documentation
</text>
<text start="18393.46" dur="3.812">
here in this exercise file. So if we go ahead and open that link, what
</text>
<text start="18397.272" dur="6.39">
you&#39;ll see is that cards contain content actions about a single subject.
</text>
<text start="18403.662" dur="4.568">
And here we have a great interactive demo, showcasing the types of cards.
</text>
<text start="18408.23" dur="5.28">
There are several options for the elevated card, and then there&#39;s also an outline card
</text>
<text start="18413.51" dur="5.16">
and in our figma file. We&#39;re going to go ahead and build out Four
</text>
<text start="18418.67" dur="5.432">
variants, three of them are elevated. So the elevated type here you can see, within
</text>
<text start="18424.102" dur="4.27">
this there is a drop shadow being utilized here on this elevated variant.
</text>
<text start="18428.372" dur="4.29">
And then on the outline variant, it&#39;s literally just an outline as opposed to using drop shadow.
</text>
<text start="18432.662" dur="3.45">
So those are the differences between the two cards types.
</text>
<text start="18436.112" dur="5.298">
And both those two card types, the elevated type and the outline type, have options with
</text>
<text start="18441.41" dur="3.56">
media supportive text, and buttons, and you can mix and match them go ahead and mess around
</text>
<text start="18444.97" dur="5.75">
with those get familiar with what&#39;s possible with these types of cards.
</text>
<text start="18450.72" dur="5.7">
And there&#39;s a lot of great context around how to use cards and cards are technically
</text>
<text start="18456.42" dur="3.612">
surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.
</text>
<text start="18460.032" dur="5">
And they should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information, elements like
</text>
<text start="18465.032" dur="2.978">
text and images. As you can see, in the interactive demo, there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="18468.01" dur="6.37">
the text and the image example. And we have some actions to some buttons are
</text>
<text start="18474.38" dur="2.072">specifically about that single topic in the card.</text>
<text start="18476.452" dur="3.718">
And here are some principles where this card is contained.
</text>
<text start="18480.17" dur="4.23">
They&#39;re identified as a single contained unit, it is independent and can stand alone without
</text>
<text start="18484.4" dur="5.7">
relying on surrounding elements for context. And it is individual, a card cannot merge
</text>
<text start="18490.1" dur="2.65">with another card or divided into multiple cards.</text>
<text start="18492.75" dur="8.19">
And here we have a breakdown of the anatomy. And here, as you can see, the only the the
</text>
<text start="18500.94" dur="2.922">
card container is the only required element in a card.
</text>
<text start="18503.862" dur="8.09">
All other elements shown are optional. So this container here is the holds all the
</text>
<text start="18511.952" dur="3.058">
cart elements. And that is actually the only required element.
</text>
<text start="18515.01" dur="6.56">
So what this indicates is that card layouts are very to support the types of content they
</text>
<text start="18521.57" dur="3.34">
contain. And it&#39;s really specific on your needs when
</text>
<text start="18524.91" dur="3.78">
when building out cards. So when you try to implement this as a system
</text>
<text start="18528.69" dur="4.752">
in figma, all these optional variants should actually be their own elements when you publish
</text>
<text start="18533.442" dur="3.388">them. So you can then start to build out your into</text>
<text start="18536.83" dur="5.85">
your own card individually. So it has all the defined functionality.
</text>
<text start="18542.68" dur="5.25">
Because if you just create these specific cards, maybe there are certain things you
</text>
<text start="18547.93" dur="4.242">
don&#39;t need from it, which you will need to remove, therefore, needing to create your
</text>
<text start="18552.172" dur="4.308">
own from scratch, which is why we want to build it from the ground up utilizing elements
</text>
<text start="18556.48" dur="4.36">
as opposed to refactoring one that&#39;s already been built.
</text>
<text start="18560.84" dur="4.112">
It&#39;s more modular in that sense. Here&#39;s some great, you know, breakdown of
</text>
<text start="18564.952" dur="5.028">
behavior usage and whatnot. And I grabbed these screenshots of the specs.
</text>
<text start="18569.98" dur="6.292">
And what I really like about the specs is that it states for cards, is that the section
</text>
<text start="18576.272" dur="7.168">
should not be read as prescriptive, or, or exhaustive, or also definite, these cards

<text start="18583.44" dur="4.15">
have no singular layout, type of graphic or image size.
</text>
<text start="18587.59" dur="3.73">
So and So none of this is extremely specified. So what they&#39;re trying to state is that it
</text>
<text start="18591.32" dur="2.66">
is designed to meet the needs of the content they present.
</text>
<text start="18593.98" dur="3.15">
So, so the content the designer is trying to present.
</text>
<text start="18597.13" dur="4.61">
So it is flexible in that sense that you can build out a card to your needs.
</text>
<text start="18601.74" dur="5.99">
And it shows a variety of layouts that help showcase how flexible It really is.
</text>
<text start="18607.73" dur="4.61">
So we&#39;ll go ahead with that said, jump into figma.
</text>
<text start="18612.34" dur="3.17">
And now that we&#39;re in figma, we&#39;re gonna go ahead and create the first card type.
</text>
<text start="18615.51" dur="7.82">
And one thing important about this is that the elevation for the rest of state of a car
</text>
<text start="18623.33" dur="3.672">
is set to one dip. So in under my under the under elevation here
</text>
<text start="18627.002" dur="4.928">
in the material design guidelines, there&#39;s a table of default values, which have already
</text>
<text start="18631.93" dur="5.772">
gone over a few times before, and it shows that the card at the rested state is set to
</text>
<text start="18637.702" dur="6.898">
one dip on the right there. And when it is picked up, when this card is
</text>
<text start="18644.6" dur="5.72">
being interacted with or picked up, it utilizes the eight dip default elevation value.
</text>
<text start="18650.32" dur="4.502">
So just just a side note there, because we will need to know that to implement the elevated
</text>
<text start="18654.822" dur="6.808">
portion of the cards we build up. So with that said, let&#39;s go ahead and get
</text>
<text start="18661.63" dur="5.44">
to cracking on this elevated card yours. So we have is a title.
</text>
<text start="18667.07" dur="2.92">
But we&#39;re gonna go ahead and define the frame here.
</text>
<text start="18669.99" dur="7.132">
So we have the background color style of surfaces surface here, so it&#39;s just white, and the
</text>
<text start="18677.122" dur="5.208">
rounded corners are set to four are actually that set to eight.
</text>
<text start="18682.33" dur="4.14">
And we&#39;re gonna go ahead and copy the name of this.
</text>
<text start="18686.47" dur="4.712">
So I&#39;ve already named these. So these cards live under the elevated category
</text>
<text start="18691.182" dur="8.57">
and this has a title, some copy, body copy, and image and actions, which is all stated
</text>
<text start="18699.752" dur="2.7">
there. So I&#39;m gonna click on that rename this layer,
</text>
<text start="18702.452" dur="4.57">
or frame minaret. And now we can go ahead and specify the width
</text>
<text start="18707.022" dur="7.218">
and height of this search set to 344 dips in terms of width 148 dips and height.
</text>
<text start="18714.24" dur="5.24">
Now that we have that specified the The more I look at these Quarter this quarter as it
</text>
<text start="18719.48" dur="4.83">
should be set to four. Now that we&#39;re good to go, it just looked
</text>
<text start="18724.31" dur="5.352">
different when we didn&#39;t resize it to its proper dimensions, which is fine.
</text>
<text start="18729.662" dur="4.068">
So now what we know is that this utilizes two buttons.
</text>
<text start="18733.73" dur="2.46">
And we can pull in a placeholder image from our assets.
</text>
<text start="18736.19" dur="5.922">
To figure out what with our material design system library enable, we can go ahead and
</text>
<text start="18742.112" dur="4.808">
search in our assets panel for QA type, and I can just type in placeholder and there we
</text>
<text start="18746.92" dur="3.192">go. I can also use this icon placeholder as an</text>
<text start="18750.112" dur="4.298">
image placeholder. So if I drag this in here, I can set the width
</text>
<text start="18754.41" dur="5.31">
and height there to add dips. And then I can ensure that I am positioning
</text>
<text start="18759.72" dur="7.112">
this properly, by 16, dips on top on the top and right, and I&#39;m going to sure set the constraints
</text>
<text start="18766.832" dur="9.418">
to top and right so that it sticks, it stays it maintains that spacing on the top and right
</text>
<text start="18776.25" dur="6.532">
when resized. Now we can go ahead in our assets panel and
</text>
<text start="18782.782" dur="4.73">
search for buttons. And here we have the text button variant,
</text>
<text start="18787.512" dur="10.868">
all we can do is label this action one. And I can select this again and just set the
</text>
<text start="18798.38" dur="5.902">
spacing properly. So this spacing is set to 16 from the beginning
</text>
<text start="18804.282" dur="5.41">
of this text. So what that means is I pull out my rulers
</text>
<text start="18809.692" dur="5.868">
and I moved this over 16 pixels. Right now it&#39;s 16 pixels to the left or dips
</text>
<text start="18815.56" dur="5.95">
to the left of of the frame. But it wants the typography to be the beginning
</text>
<text start="18821.51" dur="5.95">
of the text to be 16 dips away. So what I can do with this space properly,
</text>
<text start="18827.46" dur="4.59">
in regards to the bounding box of the button, I can add this ruler here.
</text>
<text start="18832.05" dur="3.26">
And with that ruler, I can go ahead and push this text inward.
</text>
<text start="18835.31" dur="6.99">
So now that text is 16 dips to the left of the of the of the parent frame there.
</text>
<text start="18842.3" dur="8.122">
And then I can go ahead and just duplicate this and it is set to eight dips to the right,
</text>
<text start="18850.422" dur="5.66">
the second action here the second button, or we label that action too.
</text>
<text start="18856.082" dur="4.01">
And we should be good. And now we just need to add in our body copy
</text>
<text start="18860.092" dur="5.348">
and a title. So what I&#39;m going to pull out my text here,
</text>
<text start="18865.44" dur="5.041">
ensure that that&#39;s set to text and text and iconography color style, which has had a high
</text>
<text start="18870.481" dur="7.319">
emphasis and I&#39;m going to label this title whoops, I&#39;m going to select the proper textile.
</text>
<text start="18877.8" dur="8.16">
And that should be set to one let&#39;s see here, subtitle one I currently have specified.
</text>
<text start="18885.96" dur="3.652">
So title goes here. And with that specified, I&#39;m gonna make sure
</text>
<text start="18889.612" dur="4.958">
the type in the type details the resizing is set to auto width, so it snaps accordingly,
</text>
<text start="18894.57" dur="3.75">
and adheres to the proper line height specified in our type system.
</text>
<text start="18898.32" dur="4.802">
And I&#39;m gonna use my shortcut keys option w n A to snap to the top and left, and then
</text>
<text start="18903.122" dur="6.008">
push this over twice, and down twice. So I have, so I have padding top and left
</text>
<text start="18909.13" dur="5.45">
set to 16 because I&#39;ve modified my nudge amount to eight on the small nudge as opposed to
</text>
<text start="18914.58" dur="3.9">
my big nudge. So I&#39;ve reversed this, I highly recommend
</text>
<text start="18918.48" dur="5.812">
you modifying your judgment to that so you don&#39;t have to move it incremented by one all
</text>
<text start="18924.292" dur="3.359">
the time. Since this system is divisible by eight, I
</text>
<text start="18927.651" dur="5.881">
can just move it in increments of eight every time I use the arrow keys, which is very efficient.
</text>
<text start="18933.532" dur="5.888">
So I&#39;m going to duplicate this style here. And what we have what we&#39;re seeing here is
</text>
<text start="18939.42" dur="11.49">
our textbox should, let&#39;s specify the body to body one there wo two, body two, and text
</text>
<text start="18950.91" dur="5.372">
to body two and then go ahead and apply medium emphasis to the color style.
</text>
<text start="18956.282" dur="4.478">
And with that media emphasis applied, I&#39;m going to just copy what&#39;s written in this
</text>
<text start="18960.76" dur="4.582">spec component, secondary line text lorem ipsum.</text>
<text start="18965.342" dur="8.158">
De lor, sit omit. Not sure if that&#39;s actually a word.
</text>
<text start="18973.5" dur="3.59">
That&#39;s all right. And now that I have that specified, I&#39;m gonna
</text>
<text start="18977.09" dur="2.98">
push this up eight pixels. And what I want to ensure is that the text
</text>
<text start="18980.07" dur="6.43">
box is 16 pixels to the right of the image right now it&#39;s set to 21.
</text>
<text start="18986.5" dur="5.97">
So I can go ahead and increase that by five. And now it&#39;s set to 16.
</text>
<text start="18992.47" dur="8.83">
When I can do is set the constraints to top left and right and bottom if need be.
</text>
<text start="19001.3" dur="5.782">
And then as you can see here, our buttons are eight dips from the top of this bount
</text>
<text start="19007.082" dur="6.968">
text bounding box and everything is divisible has the proper measurements and whatnot so
</text>
<text start="19014.05" dur="7.88">
that is fantastic. Now all we have to do is just double check
</text>
<text start="19021.93" dur="9.5">
our parameters here, things are set to 16. And we are good to go, we have now created
</text>
<text start="19031.43" dur="4.45">
our first card, actually, the last thing we need to do is go ahead and go to our effects
</text>
<text start="19035.88" dur="3.34">and apply that elevation. So that to one dip.</text>
<text start="19039.22" dur="5.12">
And now we&#39;re good to go. So we&#39;ve created our first card.
</text>
<text start="19044.34" dur="11.26">
And we can kind of double check some things and see if this utilizes a different Subtitle
</text>
<text start="19055.6" dur="6.89">
by referencing materials documentation. So if we go to our specs and just scroll up
</text>
<text start="19062.49" dur="8.632">
a bit, it&#39;ll tell you it, the title actually uses an h6 and it uses body one.
</text>
<text start="19071.122" dur="9.25">
So if I say if I selected body one, whoops. But that&#39;s for a certain theme.
</text>
<text start="19080.372" dur="6.42">
So just take note of that, that we should adhere to the styles being used and referenced
</text>
<text start="19086.792" dur="5.728">
if, even though the properties may be different in another theme, it&#39;s still using those those
</text>
<text start="19092.52" dur="2.74">
styles. So now I&#39;m going to go ahead and change the
</text>
<text start="19095.26" dur="5.012">subtitle to an age six. And that is good to go.</text>
<text start="19100.272" dur="8.27">
I now have everything attached accordingly. And yeah, we&#39;re good.
</text>
<text start="19108.542" dur="7.768">
So apparently, this just uses Body Body one and met it for metadata, it uses body two.
</text>
<text start="19116.31" dur="7.82">
So let&#39;s go ahead and modify this accordingly. And now that we have modified that our card
</text>
<text start="19124.13" dur="2.71">
should be good to go. But it actually doesn&#39;t look like that&#39;s a
</text>
<text start="19126.84" dur="8.322">
proper textile, that should be smaller, the font, so we&#39;ll leave it as is.
</text>
<text start="19135.162" dur="3.998">
And we&#39;re going to go all the constraints and measurements are properly set.
</text>
<text start="19139.16" dur="6.792">
And we can go ahead and duplicate this and publish this as a main component.
</text>
<text start="19145.952" dur="6.538">
So we now have our first component created. And we can even go ahead and create another
</text>
<text start="19152.49" dur="4.31">
version of this where it&#39;s actually an outline card.
</text>
<text start="19156.8" dur="9.54">
So for the outline card, what we can do is we&#39;re going to want to do first is remove
</text>
<text start="19166.34" dur="8.102">
this elevation style, add a stroke, and it&#39;s set to one pixel as one dip, as you can see
</text>
<text start="19174.442" dur="5.708">
here, one dip, and the color set to undersurfaces surface overlay.
</text>
<text start="19180.15" dur="6.92">
And that is the outline of the the card. As you can see, there&#39;s zoomed in.
</text>
<text start="19187.07" dur="8.98">
And with that a lot of these properties are actually the same, but the height of our card
</text>
<text start="19196.05" dur="6.68">
is is is taller. And one thing I did mess up on this card is
</text>
<text start="19202.73" dur="7.75">
that that the spacing below these two buttons should be set to eight dips instead of 16
</text>
<text start="19210.48" dur="3.562">
dips. So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and click on this Hold
</text>
<text start="19214.042" dur="5.058">COMMAND as I as I change these dimensions here.</text>
<text start="19219.1" dur="3.61">
And now I have it set to eight deaths from the bottom.
</text>
<text start="19222.71" dur="5.89">
And this card should be good to go. Now go ahead and touch this up here.
</text>
<text start="19228.6" dur="6.32">
I might just reduplicate this. So I don&#39;t want to modify the dimensions or
</text>
<text start="19234.92" dur="4.92">
the spacing there and detach it holding option command B.
</text>
<text start="19239.84" dur="5.672">
And then I&#39;m going to re label this layer and remove that elevation.
</text>
<text start="19245.512" dur="4.418">
And we&#39;re going to want to select outlined the naming convention I&#39;ve specified here
</text>
<text start="19249.93" dur="5.16">
already beforehand. And it this naming convention clearly states
</text>
<text start="19255.09" dur="6.032">
what type of card This is. It&#39;s an outline card with an overline utilizing
</text>
<text start="19261.122" dur="9.138">
overline a title, which includes the body copy blood, and then an image and some actions
</text>
<text start="19270.26" dur="4.85">
being those actions being our buttons. So now I&#39;m gonna go ahead and reapply that
</text>
<text start="19275.11" dur="4.422">
stroke color style, which is surfaces surface overlay.
</text>
<text start="19279.532" dur="7.018">
And that&#39;s set to one dip or pixel. And what we&#39;re going to do is increase the
</text>
<text start="19286.55" dur="5.09">
height of this card real quick. And we&#39;re going to need to push this content
</text>
<text start="19291.64" dur="9.5">
down because the baseline of this headline or this header is 40 dips away from the baseline
</text>
<text start="19301.14" dur="5.62">
of the overline text. So what I can do is just push this content
</text>
<text start="19306.76" dur="9.32">
down, duplicate this textile, or this text and then change it to overline with overload
</text>
<text start="19316.08" dur="3.05">
specified. I&#39;m just going to write out oh line.
</text>
<text start="19319.13" dur="7.98">
And then I&#39;m going to ensure that it is 16 dips from the top, which it is.
</text>
<text start="19327.11" dur="7.02">
So now that we have our overline specified, I&#39;m going to go ahead and make sure that the
</text>
<text start="19334.13" dur="6.45">
baseline is 40 dips away from, from the typography here from the from the title here, and this
</text>
<text start="19340.58" dur="5.94">
title uses an h5. So it&#39;s slightly bigger, as as you can see,
</text>
<text start="19346.52" dur="7.992">
now I&#39;m gonna go ahead and double check, add some, add this red line to the first baseline,
</text>
<text start="19354.512" dur="5.848">
add a red line to the second baseline to the title here, which is I&#39;m going to call it
</text>
<text start="19360.36" dur="3.44">
headline five. And then I&#39;m gonna grab a square and just
</text>
<text start="19363.8" dur="2.35">
calculate that manually. So that is currently set to 41.
</text>
<text start="19366.15" dur="5.96">
So we want to do we were pretty close, push that up one by default.
</text>
<text start="19372.11" dur="5.912">
And now it&#39;s set to 40. Right there, as you can see, which is exactly
</text>
<text start="19378.022" dur="2.818">what we wanted to achieve. So that is fantastic.</text>
<text start="19380.84" dur="4.84">
I can have my rulers hitting shift R. And we&#39;re good to go in that regard.
</text>
<text start="19385.68" dur="5.32">
So let&#39;s go ahead and close out this spacing from the headline and this text.
</text>
<text start="19391" dur="8.92">
And this baseline of the headline is 24 dips above the baseline of this body copy.
</text>
<text start="19399.92" dur="2.29">So we can go ahead and do the same process here.</text>
<text start="19402.21" dur="12.72">
And just add another red line here to this body copy, grab a rectangle and ensure that
</text>
<text start="19414.93" dur="5.62">
this is all being done properly and is currently has a height of 27.
</text>
<text start="19420.55" dur="7.482">
So we&#39;re going to want to do is push that up through few pixels and ensure that this
</text>
<text start="19428.032" dur="4.23">
is set to 24. Now, the baseline is not 24 pips away from
</text>
<text start="19432.262" dur="8.499">
the baseline of the headline, the header five, specifically, h5 and our textiles there.
</text>
<text start="19440.761" dur="8.369">
And we&#39;ll go ahead and double check our spacing between the body copy and buttons.
</text>
<text start="19449.13" dur="13.37">
And that for some reason isn&#39;t specified in our spec, but it is specified here in this
</text>
<text start="19462.5" dur="10.19">
so it may looks like it&#39;s set to 16 pixels below the typography and then below the buttons
</text>
<text start="19472.69" dur="7.16">
themselves. I go ahead and rename those buttons to buttons
</text>
<text start="19479.85" dur="9.26">
from like getting confused between the types of buttons in the other card, I can go ahead
</text>
<text start="19489.11" dur="6.15">
and double check these elements and push them over.
</text>
<text start="19495.26" dur="8.45">
So the padding on the left is set to 16 now so that is more consistent.
</text>
<text start="19503.71" dur="5.832">
And you&#39;ll notice that the the buttons actually pushed in now in the buttons type isn&#39;t aligned
</text>
<text start="19509.542" dur="4.758">
with the type of the body copy right there. So that is important to take note of it&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="19514.3" dur="5.31">
be slow, it&#39;ll appear visually slightly indented, then I can change the spacing between the
</text>
<text start="19519.61" dur="6.28">
two buttons to eight dips again as as it should be a dips there, and then eight dips below
</text>
<text start="19525.89" dur="4.232">
the buttons. So now I&#39;m going to go ahead and just grab
</text>
<text start="19530.122" dur="2.758">this car to hold down Command and pull this up.</text>
<text start="19532.88" dur="6.47">
It&#39;s currently set to nine dip smoothie below. So if I push that up one more pixel, we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="19539.35" dur="2.38">
good to go. It&#39;s now eight dips below and now everything
</text>
<text start="19541.73" dur="8.62">
is up to spec as need be river overline the title and the body copy and the image which
</text>
<text start="19550.35" dur="4.97">
we can replace here in the fill style. And just select an image there.
</text>
<text start="19555.32" dur="4.87">
So when designers duplicate this, and then we have our actions which are buttons.
</text>
<text start="19560.19" dur="6.012">
So now that that&#39;s done, that is fantastic. We&#39;ll go ahead and create our next card.
</text>
<text start="19566.202" dur="6.09">
So got that as the main component now. Next, we&#39;re going to go ahead and tackle this
</text>
<text start="19572.292" dur="9.098">
more complex component and and what we&#39;re going to need to do is we actually need this

component here we have this set of stars so stars in the spec, I&#39;m going to disregard
</text>
<text start="19589.66" dur="5.36">
that from this component because I actually have some purposes for the this component
</text>
<text start="19595.02" dur="3.54">
in particular that I want to use later on. So I&#39;m going to build without the stars because
</text>
<text start="19598.56" dur="8.982">
I don&#39;t need to communicate the those ratings. And what I can do is create this variant year,
</text>
<text start="19607.542" dur="9.41">
specify the width to 344 dips and the height 510 dips and the corner radius to four.
</text>
<text start="19616.952" dur="4.398">
This is an elevated car. So I&#39;m gonna go to my effects and apply the
</text>
<text start="19621.35" dur="7.67">
one dip elevation, then we&#39;ll go to my Phil and select surfaces surface color style.
</text>
<text start="19629.02" dur="9.91">
And what that is linked, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and just ensure that I have the proper name
</text>
<text start="19638.93" dur="8.15">
for this component in my components and then we have a image placeholder as you can see
</text>
<text start="19647.08" dur="8.5">
here, I can just grab the placeholder that we have in our system and specify the width
</text>
<text start="19655.58" dur="6.622">
to 344 dips, and then the height 294. And then a hold down Option W and a to snap
</text>
<text start="19662.202" dur="7.17">
that properly into our component as needed. And then we&#39;ll set the constraints to top
</text>
<text start="19669.372" dur="6.33">
left and right, so that way when this stretches to needs to be stretched, it doesn&#39;t get all
</text>
<text start="19675.702" dur="4.398">
funky. it&#39;ll snap to all the edges properly, so it
</text>
<text start="19680.1" dur="4.47">
looks clean. And with that said, we have a title that is
</text>
<text start="19684.57" dur="6">
44 dips, the baseline of this title is 44 dips from the top of this image.
</text>
<text start="19690.57" dur="10.57">
So if I go ahead and add this title in here, then apply the proper text style of subtitle
</text>
<text start="19701.14" dur="6.612">
one. Or actually, it&#39;s the h5 title, I believe.
</text>
<text start="19707.752" dur="3.718">
There we go. And now I&#39;m going to set select the resizing
</text>
<text start="19711.47" dur="7.22">
and set that to auto width, I&#39;m going to push this down and push that down a bit, push that
</text>
<text start="19718.69" dur="5.31">to 30. and double check the baseline.</text>
<text start="19724" dur="9.73">
So the baseline from the image should be set to 44, which is actually right here.
</text>
<text start="19733.73" dur="7.313">
So it&#39;s actually 24. dips from the top of the image, with the baseline
</text>
<text start="19741.043" dur="6.967">
being 44 dips from the top. And now I want to disregard these stars here.
</text>
<text start="19748.01" dur="6.58">
And even, I can add some secondary text. So at the secondary text, I&#39;m going to utilize
</text>
<text start="19754.59" dur="7.612">
the caption textiles. If I duplicate this, change the text style
</text>
<text start="19762.202" dur="6.728">
and go to caption, I can select that set, set that to secondary text.
</text>
<text start="19768.93" dur="7.87">
Make sure that&#39;s 16 Dibs from the left of the container of the card.
</text>
<text start="19776.8" dur="8.27">
And I&#39;m going to make sure both these fill styles are set to text and iconography.
</text>
<text start="19785.07" dur="4.54">
High emphasis. And once that is done, I&#39;m going to go ahead
</text>
<text start="19789.61" dur="8.38">
and duplicate this secondary textile, push it down and stretch out the text box so that
</text>
<text start="19797.99" dur="5.73">
it is 24 deaths from the right of the container the car container.
</text>
<text start="19803.72" dur="8.16">
And with that, it&#39;s going to push that over three notes set to 24 from the right to the
</text>
<text start="19811.88" dur="8.64">
constraints, the top left and right. And then I&#39;m just going to add in this body
</text>
<text start="19820.52" dur="8.182">
copy that is already in this card. And I&#39;m going to pause it real quick.
</text>
<text start="19828.702" dur="3.478">
This typography specified, you&#39;ll notice that it uses a divider too.
</text>
<text start="19832.18" dur="6.31">
So we can even pull in our divider component that we&#39;ve created a divider there, pull that
</text>
<text start="19838.49" dur="6.422">
in, and you&#39;ll notice that it is 16 has a padding of 16 dips on the left and 20 and
</text>
<text start="19844.912" dur="5.348">
16 dips on the right so we can bring and we can do the math we want to set the width of
</text>
<text start="19850.26" dur="6.83">this component is 344. And then minus 32 is 312.</text>
<text start="19857.09" dur="3.6">
So we can change the width of this to the divider to 312.
</text>
<text start="19860.69" dur="8.172">
So when we bring it into our component, and it&#39;s a little hard to grab.
</text>
<text start="19868.862" dur="7.18">
So I can just go to my Layers panel and drag it in if I need to.
</text>
<text start="19876.042" dur="6.298">
And then hold down Option H and that will align it horizontally and then option v to
</text>
<text start="19882.34" dur="6.651">
align it vertically, the alignment properly and I can push this down and ensure that that
</text>
<text start="19888.991" dur="8.961">
is 24 dips from the baseline of the second baseline of text in this body body copy.
</text>
<text start="19897.952" dur="8.138">
So if I push this up, I need to make sure that that&#39;s at the 24 so if I grab a text
</text>
<text start="19906.09" dur="7.262">
box, I can measure 24 dips from the bottom. I was rough.
</text>
<text start="19913.352" dur="2.42">Almost there. I was close.</text>
<text start="19915.772" dur="6.75">
So Now that that set to the baseline is 24 dips away.
</text>
<text start="19922.522" dur="6.608">
So I&#39;m going to push this down on more. Whoops, I&#39;m going to grab this divider, push
</text>
<text start="19929.13" dur="5.56">
it down one more pixel, and it&#39;s from, from the textbox.
</text>
<text start="19934.69" dur="4.98">
That&#39;s on this body copy, it&#39;s set to 20. So that&#39;s good to note.
</text>
<text start="19939.67" dur="5.52">
And we need to change the color of this text, the spotty copy from high emphasis to medium
</text>
<text start="19945.19" dur="4.092">emphasis. And now that is accurate.</text>
<text start="19949.282" dur="5.738">
With that divider implemented, we can go ahead and add another caption, we&#39;re actually it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="19955.02" dur="4.58">
a subtitle. So I can duplicate this one, and push this
</text>
<text start="19959.6" dur="6.12">
down a bit, label it subtitle, then just change the text style to subtitle.
</text>
<text start="19965.72" dur="7.21">
Now that we have the subtitle must like subtitle to uses a smaller subtitle it looks like just
</text>
<text start="19972.93" dur="9.64">
to maintain the hierarchy there. As these as subtitle one, I believe, and then
</text>
<text start="19982.57" dur="9.33">
just make sure that the spacing is appropriated. So it&#39;s the baseline is 36 dips from the divider,
</text>
<text start="19991.9" dur="4.46">
so we can go ahead and measure that. From this divider.
</text>
<text start="19996.36" dur="8.672">
Currently, we have it 41 dips away, so I can push up this element.
</text>
<text start="20005.032" dur="10.51">
And now we have this 36 steps away from the divider, which is great.
</text>
<text start="20015.542" dur="3.49">
And I&#39;m going to go ahead and add in some chip components.
</text>
<text start="20019.032" dur="2.648">So we have some action chips being utilized here.</text>
<text start="20021.68" dur="9.4">
So if I type in action chip, or just actually chip into our assets panel, I can drag a chip
</text>
<text start="20031.08" dur="3.952">in. And what I&#39;m gonna do with this chip is I</text>
<text start="20035.032" dur="6.158">
can duplicate it a couple times, right, and they&#39;re spaced eight dips away from each other.
</text>
<text start="20041.19" dur="6.05">
So I&#39;m gonna throw three chips in here. And they&#39;re, they&#39;re all labeled differently
</text>
<text start="20047.24" dur="8.27">
item one. One thing we need to ensure is that these
</text>
<text start="20055.51" dur="5.282">
chips utilize auto layout, and it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s utilizing auto layout right
</text>
<text start="20060.792" dur="6.16">now. Because I needed to add up auto layout to</text>
<text start="20066.952" dur="5.768">
my chips because they weren&#39;t adapting to the size of the text.
</text>
<text start="20072.72" dur="5.35">
So now if I go in and type in item one, it will maintain the proper spacing on the left
</text>
<text start="20078.07" dur="2.75">
and right. And here you can see we have four chips.
</text>
<text start="20080.82" dur="6.24">
So let&#39;s go ahead and select those. Here we have item 123, and four.
</text>
<text start="20087.06" dur="9.312">
So I&#39;m just going to label those accordingly. And now, I can go ahead and just restructure
</text>
<text start="20096.372" dur="3.378">
the spacing there, make sure those are all eight dips apart.
</text>
<text start="20099.75" dur="5.372">
And I&#39;m gonna go and drag and drop this into my v component here.
</text>
<text start="20105.122" dur="5.5">
And it specifies the baseline 14 dips away from the top of the chip.
</text>
<text start="20110.622" dur="6.458">
And I&#39;m assuming that that is actually eight dips away from from the bounding box and the
</text>
<text start="20117.08" dur="3.08">typography, I can go ahead and double check that.</text>
<text start="20120.16" dur="7.81">
And technically it is it&#39;s the baseline here is 15 pips away, but we&#39;re gonna go and maintain
</text>
<text start="20127.97" dur="5.55">
the spacing from the top of the subtitle and keep that at eight.
</text>
<text start="20133.52" dur="7.73">
And now that we have that specified, all we&#39;re missing is an action below, which is 20 steps
</text>
<text start="20141.25" dur="4.542">
away from the chip. So if I go ahead and go to my assets and type
</text>
<text start="20145.792" dur="4.15">
in my assets panel, type in button, search for that button.
</text>
<text start="20149.942" dur="10.538">
It&#39;s not appearing. So if I go ahead and re type that and it searches
</text>
<text start="20160.48" dur="8.42">
and I can grab this text button and just drag that into the canvas.
</text>
<text start="20168.9" dur="7.91">
I can just rename this to action one. And once this action is being renamed, I can
</text>
<text start="20176.81" dur="5.772">
go ahead and drag it into my new card component and ensure that the spacing is set accordingly.
</text>
<text start="20182.582" dur="5.95">
Make sure that&#39;s set to 20. That&#39;s indicated in the spec here 20 away
</text>
<text start="20188.532" dur="7.098">
and it is eight digit pixels away the the outer frame of the buttons eight dips away
</text>
<text start="20195.63" dur="5.42">
from the parent container because it will align the typography with a chip here you
</text>
<text start="20201.05" dur="5.982">
see that that&#39;s why that button is eight dips away because it aligns the typography of the
</text>
<text start="20207.032" dur="2.128">button with the rest of the content in the card.</text>
<text start="20209.16" dur="6.85">
And then I just need to specify that this is eight dips below the spacing.
</text>
<text start="20216.01" dur="6.82">
So I can grab the parent container hold down Command as I drag up, make sure that&#39;s set
</text>
<text start="20222.83" dur="4.611">
to eight, right now we have it at five. So just push this down three pixels, and we
</text>
<text start="20227.441" dur="2.699">are golden. Awesome.</text>
<text start="20230.14" dur="6.16">
So we&#39;ve now created one of the more complex card components in material design one of
</text>
<text start="20236.3" dur="5.492">
the examples again, so I&#39;m going to go ahead and challenge you to create this car component
</text>
<text start="20241.792" dur="3.058">
by yourself. And then I&#39;m going to pause the video and
</text>
<text start="20244.85" dur="5.182">
show you the optimal, optimal way of building out these car components.
</text>
<text start="20250.032" dur="5.788">
All right, I&#39;m gonna pause. So I have now finished creating all the elements,
</text>
<text start="20255.82" dur="6.292">
I created this variant here, the exact replica, and I did it a little differently this time.
</text>
<text start="20262.112" dur="3.888">
And the reason I wanted to go through this exercise the way I just did before I show
</text>
<text start="20266" dur="4.352">
you everything is very intentional, I want to showcase to you the manual process of building
</text>
<text start="20270.352" dur="2.83">
this component. And then the power of having these elements
</text>
<text start="20273.182" dur="5.628">
that I just created to, to use as building blocks for design system, not only for yourself,
</text>
<text start="20278.81" dur="4.36">
but for the designers you cater to if you ever work on design systems team.
</text>
<text start="20283.17" dur="6.47">
So here, we here you can see that we&#39;ve created we&#39;ve manually created our cards, here are
</text>
<text start="20289.64" dur="6.12">
some examples of have more composed cards. And then I went ahead during this break, and
</text>
<text start="20295.76" dur="5.102">
not only made these elements here, but I compose them properly.
</text>
<text start="20300.862" dur="5.198">
So when I say I compose them properly, these these are all specifically elements for cards,
</text>
<text start="20306.06" dur="6.19">
the width of these cards are defined by 344, certain variants of them.
</text>
<text start="20312.25" dur="5.08">
And here&#39;s like, we have them labeled as elements, textiles, and you can think of them as tiles
</text>
<text start="20317.33" dur="4.88">
as you, as you add tile onto a floor, you can arrange them and add them and stack them
</text>
<text start="20322.21" dur="2.792">
and whatnot. So that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re going to do.
</text>
<text start="20325.002" dur="6.858">
So with these elements, I&#39;m gonna go I can break down what these are composed of.
</text>
<text start="20331.86" dur="4.69">
And then it&#39;s wrapped in a frame with the proper background color, which is set to surface,
</text>
<text start="20336.55" dur="5.92">
the surface and then the proper elevation, the resting elevations being set to one dip.
</text>
<text start="20342.47" dur="4.86">
And then of course, the the elevated status set to eight dips there, as you can see the
</text>
<text start="20347.33" dur="5.792">
two differences there. And in this frame, if I click on this frame,
</text>
<text start="20353.122" dur="6.448">
go ahead and I go ahead and check out. Whoops, I go ahead and check out the elements
</text>
<text start="20359.57" dur="4.022">
in this frame, I have three pieces in this component.
</text>
<text start="20363.592" dur="4.08">
So I can drag these out. And notice that they don&#39;t have any background
</text>
<text start="20367.672" dur="4.438">
color applied to them except this is an icon, I mean image placeholder.
</text>
<text start="20372.11" dur="6.37">
So and see this is what is composed of these three elements here.
</text>
<text start="20378.48" dur="6.17">
So that is super important to note and understand. So uses these these elements to start building
</text>
<text start="20384.65" dur="5.34">
and adding on top of each other into the card. And these are all elements you can have in
</text>
<text start="20389.99" dur="3.718">your design system. And it&#39;s explicitly.</text>
<text start="20393.708" dur="4.002">
That&#39;s why it&#39;s there. So we can go ahead and build out an example.
</text>
<text start="20397.71" dur="6.01">
So you could create several examples of this. So we can start off with this heading, I can
</text>
<text start="20403.72" dur="3.542">
copy that heading, and maybe the heading has supportive text, right.
</text>
<text start="20407.262" dur="9.378">
And then I can go go ahead and add in like an image, this supportive image above the
</text>
<text start="20416.64" dur="3.02">heading. So we have the media and then the heading</text>
<text start="20419.66" dur="4.542">there. And then we have the support of text below.</text>
<text start="20424.202" dur="4.888">
So what I can do now that these are all connected, I can select them all and then wrap them in
</text>
<text start="20429.09" dur="4.42">
a frame, I select them all and then I hit option Command G to create a frame.
</text>
<text start="20433.51" dur="5.25">
And now I&#39;m going to click on the fill color, go to surfaces and select surface.
</text>
<text start="20438.76" dur="6.25">
Ensure I have the proper rounded corner radius that that the four pixels or dips there, and
</text>
<text start="20445.01" dur="5.25">
then click clip content. And we&#39;re gonna go to effects and select one
</text>
<text start="20450.26" dur="5.83">
dip on the elevation styles and look out quick, we were able to build a card component using
</text>
<text start="20456.09" dur="4.672">
elements as opposed to going in and ensuring everything&#39;s pixel perfect dragging and dropping
</text>
<text start="20460.762" dur="3.728">
stuff around. So if you do it, if you build out these elements
</text>
<text start="20464.49" dur="7.1">
once pixel with pixel precision pixel perfection, you should be good to go.
</text>
<text start="20471.59" dur="7.112">
Today, we&#39;re at a design Academy, and we&#39;re going to be creating some chip components.
</text>
<text start="20478.702" dur="2.378">
And let&#39;s just give you the general overview of this video.
</text>
<text start="20481.08" dur="5.262">
We&#39;re going to Overview The chip components first, how they&#39;re used, what they are, and
</text>
<text start="20486.342" dur="5.908">
then also building out these chip components. And we&#39;ll go ahead and open the link here
</text>
<text start="20492.25" dur="6.012">
in our exercise file for the chips documentation. And once that opens up, go ahead and once
</text>
<text start="20498.262" dur="6.458">
that loads, you can see that chips are compact elements that represent an input attribute
</text>
<text start="20504.72" dur="6.01">or action. So this is here in our design.</text>
<text start="20510.73" dur="8.74">
This is our chip here as you can see, and it is essentially in this text Where it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="20519.47" dur="6.362">
specifying who to send an email to. And it&#39;s this person labeled Peyton Smith,
</text>
<text start="20525.832" dur="4.828">
named pin Smith, excuse me. And as you can see, once the email has been
</text>
<text start="20530.66" dur="4.17">
typed out or the username, and it&#39;s been selected, it turns into a chip.
</text>
<text start="20534.83" dur="5.76">
And there is a little image as well to represent who that user is that profile picture.
</text>
<text start="20540.59" dur="3.59">
And with that context in mind, we can go ahead and understand the usage.
</text>
<text start="20544.18" dur="5.62">
It allows users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.
</text>
<text start="20549.8" dur="5.84">
While buttons are expected to appear consistently and with familiar calls to actions.
</text>
<text start="20555.64" dur="5.63">
shifts should appear dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements.
</text>
<text start="20561.27" dur="6.3">
And here you can see the principles they&#39;re intentionally compact, relevant, so they have
</text>
<text start="20567.57" dur="7.37">
clear and helpful relay information, information in relation to the content or task that is
</text>
<text start="20574.94" dur="4.5">
represented in the UI. And chips should make tasks easier to complete
</text>
<text start="20579.44" dur="5.092">
or content easier to sort. And here we have all of the chip types here,
</text>
<text start="20584.532" dur="4.798">
as you can see. And we have an anatomy of one of the most
</text>
<text start="20589.33" dur="3.9">
complex chips here. So we have the generic container that holds
</text>
<text start="20593.23" dur="4.26">
all of the chip elements and their size is determined by those elements.
</text>
<text start="20597.49" dur="5.34">
Here you can see we have an optional thumbnail, which is the leading icon here, which can
</text>
<text start="20602.83" dur="7.57">
be utilized to identify entities such as profiles, by displaying an avatar logo or icon there.
</text>
<text start="20610.4" dur="6.602">
And then we also have the the text, of course, to display the entity name, description, tag
</text>
<text start="20617.002" dur="5.968">
action, or, or conversational. And then the fourth element to this anatomic
</text>
<text start="20622.97" dur="6.572">
breakdown is the input chips can include a remove icon, indicating that you can remove
</text>
<text start="20629.542" dur="5.718">
that entire chip if need be. And we&#39;re we have a breakdown of all the usages
</text>
<text start="20635.26" dur="2.29">
for the different types. But we&#39;re not going to get into that I recommend
</text>
<text start="20637.55" dur="4.64">
you going through and consuming that information as needed.
</text>
<text start="20642.19" dur="2.77">
And here, we have all the types that we&#39;re going to be creating.
</text>
<text start="20644.96" dur="6.17">
But one thing I want you to note is that three of these chips are the same, but there are
</text>
<text start="20651.13" dur="5.5">
explicitly stated as different chips in this documentation.
</text>
<text start="20656.63" dur="3.28">
And I just want us to kind of take note of that and pay attention.
</text>
<text start="20659.91" dur="7.09">
So here in the specs, we have this action chip, the outline chip choice chip filter.
</text>
<text start="20667" dur="6.17">
And we have the input chips and the chips, an example of chips in groups where they have
</text>
<text start="20673.17" dur="3.31">a spacing of eight dips there between each chip.</text>
<text start="20676.48" dur="4.962">
And you&#39;ll notice that the action choice and filter chip are all the same exact chip, but
</text>
<text start="20681.442" dur="5.368">
the underlying functionality could be different, which is kind of the point I wanted to get
</text>
<text start="20686.81" dur="2.552">
to there. And with that stated, we can go ahead and
</text>
<text start="20689.362" dur="2.548">
jump into our finger file and start building out these chips.
</text>
<text start="20691.91" dur="5.75">
And I&#39;m gonna go ahead, ensure that I have my material design system library enabled
</text>
<text start="20697.66" dur="3.962">
in this exercise file. And with that said, we can go ahead and start
</text>
<text start="20701.622" dur="4.468">
creating these chips. So with this chip credit, I&#39;m gonna go ahead
</text>
<text start="20706.09" dur="5.9">
and create a frame. And before I do, I&#39;m gonna live copy that
</text>
<text start="20711.99" dur="6.51">
name, label this label this action frame name, because this is going to be our action chip.
</text>
<text start="20718.5" dur="7.09">
And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and add the the background color surface under surfaces overlay.
</text>
<text start="20725.59" dur="3.03">
And then I&#39;m going to set the rounded corners to 16.
</text>
<text start="20728.62" dur="5.15">
So it&#39;s nice and nice and round there. And I&#39;m going to set the height to 32.
</text>
<text start="20733.77" dur="5.61">
And then we&#39;ll go ahead and modify the, the width as needed.
</text>
<text start="20739.38" dur="2.622">
And the nice thing is we&#39;ll be able to quickly add on allows for this.
</text>
<text start="20742.002" dur="2.95">
So it dynamically adapts to the text string within it.
</text>
<text start="20744.952" dur="3.458">
So you don&#39;t have to manually resize it, which is very helpful.
</text>
<text start="20748.41" dur="3.86">
So I want to go ahead and add this text style here.
</text>
<text start="20752.27" dur="3.912">
And by adding this textile, I can go ahead and select the body to textile because that
</text>
<text start="20756.182" dur="4.558">
is what&#39;s utilizing chips. And I can go ahead and label this action chip.
</text>
<text start="20760.74" dur="5.75">
And I want by default, my my my typography to resize automatically.
</text>
<text start="20766.49" dur="3.34">
And then I&#39;m going to go ahead and center this.
</text>
<text start="20769.83" dur="4.902">
And what I&#39;m going to do is hold down shift a, that creates auto layout, then I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="20774.732" dur="3.748">
to hit shift a again, which creates auto layout on the parent frame.
</text>
<text start="20778.48" dur="5.23">
And now you&#39;ll notice I can adjust the dip padding to 12 dips the left and right as opposed
</text>
<text start="20783.71" dur="3.18">
to fit the one here, which is what specified currently.
</text>
<text start="20786.89" dur="2.892">
So if I type in 12, I have now shrunken that to 12.
</text>
<text start="20789.782" dur="6.778">
And it currently says 13 because autolayout by default adds one extra pixel horizontally
</text>
<text start="20796.56" dur="5.052">
and vertically to your element, which is annoying in my opinion.
</text>
<text start="20801.612" dur="4.658">
So we if we reset that you&#39;ll now it&#39;ll showcase that it&#39;s set to 12 on the left and right
</text>
<text start="20806.27" dur="6.72">
and is vertically centered, which is great on the y axis and we have now created our
</text>
<text start="20812.99" dur="4.14">
first chip and we can go ahead and bang out the two other chips here.
</text>
<text start="20817.13" dur="4.402">
The choice chip in the filter So here are some intricate things to understand about
</text>
<text start="20821.532" dur="5.618">
the design system. And here is where decisions are made on on
</text>
<text start="20827.15" dur="5.522">
a per team basis, as I like to call it. So we have this action ship, right.
</text>
<text start="20832.672" dur="8.428">
And there are three types of this, this action ship where they all look the same visually.
</text>
<text start="20841.1" dur="5.05">
But the the functionality under the hood could be much different and utilize in different
</text>
<text start="20846.15" dur="7.712">
scenarios. So say this component, built in code is represented
</text>
<text start="20853.862" dur="4.018">
differently, does that mean you want to reflect that in your designs as well? Or do you just
</text>
<text start="20857.88" dur="7.42">
want to utilize the same exact design and just call that the action chip, instead of
</text>
<text start="20865.3" dur="7.122">
having the actual chip choice and filter chip? Well, to be consistent, in terms of the naming
</text>
<text start="20872.422" dur="4.84">
conventions you have in your design files, and what engineers have developed on the front
</text>
<text start="20877.262" dur="5.928">
end, you may want to create three, three variants of this.
</text>
<text start="20883.19" dur="3.47">
So in order to do so all of the styling is the same.
</text>
<text start="20886.66" dur="5.852">
So I&#39;m just going to duplicate this, and I&#39;m going to make this action ship a component.
</text>
<text start="20892.512" dur="5.61">
And with that being a component, I&#39;m going to label this label.
</text>
<text start="20898.122" dur="5.63">
And then I&#39;m going to go ahead and rename this the the choice ship, and then enter and
</text>
<text start="20903.752" dur="5.478">
rename the frame as label. And then I&#39;m going to rename this filter chip,
</text>
<text start="20909.23" dur="7.41">
I&#39;m gonna label that filter. And I&#39;m gonna rename this text autolayout
</text>
<text start="20916.64" dur="7.37">
frame to label layer two label, I can go ahead and select both of these, both of those elements
</text>
<text start="20924.01" dur="3.33">
and click on that and select create multiple components.
</text>
<text start="20927.34" dur="4.62">
And now I have all three component variants, which is very important, what I&#39;m going to
</text>
<text start="20931.96" dur="4.702">
need to do is rename them. So this is the choice chip.
</text>
<text start="20936.662" dur="5.96">
This is the filter chip. And now we are rocking and rolling, we have
</text>
<text start="20942.622" dur="8.058">
those three variants knocked out of the park. And what we can do now is focus on the outline
</text>
<text start="20950.68" dur="7.28">
chip and the input chip. So with that said, I&#39;m going to go ahead and
</text>
<text start="20957.96" dur="8.53">
grab this chip here, to get a head start. And what this chip has currently is I&#39;m gonna
</text>
<text start="20966.49" dur="11.462">
detach this and label this out action outlined. And once it&#39;s labeled properly, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="20977.952" dur="4.598">
to go ahead and get rid of the autolayout by holding down Command Option, actually just
</text>
<text start="20982.55" dur="5.902">
Option Shift A, then I&#39;m going to do the same exact thing to the other autolab frame layer,
</text>
<text start="20988.452" dur="8.258">
and then hit Option Shift a and then hit Command Shift G to remove that frame from the Texas
</text>
<text start="20996.71" dur="4.14">
it&#39;s not needed. So with this typography here, what we&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="21000.85" dur="6.192">
to need right now is an icon placeholder because this is an outline chip.
</text>
<text start="21007.042" dur="6.088">
So what I can go ahead and do is in this file, I already have an icon placeholder, copy that
</text>
<text start="21013.13" dur="6.29">
and I&#39;m going to hold that command on this bounding box on the left to stretch that out
</text>
<text start="21019.42" dur="3.19">
and paste this and I&#39;m going to snap this to the left.
</text>
<text start="21022.61" dur="7.1">
And make sure that is four pixels to the left there and is centered vertically, and then
</text>
<text start="21029.71" dur="5.48">
move this text over, add this constraint to set the constraints in this text right and
</text>
<text start="21035.19" dur="7">
center on the y axis and then push this over until the typography is eight pixels away
</text>
<text start="21042.19" dur="7.87">
from the icon here. So it&#39;s got to move this over about essentially
</text>
<text start="21050.06" dur="3.232">
three pixels. So I got to move that over one more pixel.
</text>
<text start="21053.292" dur="4.91">
Whoops, there we go. Once that&#39;s specified there, we got those
</text>
<text start="21058.202" dur="5.83">
specs set properly. We&#39;ve got a and the padding is set to 12 tips
</text>
<text start="21064.032" dur="2.078">
on the right and eight on the left, we are good to go.
</text>
<text start="21066.11" dur="6.32">
And that is our action outlined action chip. I am what we&#39;re going to want to do now is
</text>
<text start="21072.43" dur="6.72">
specify a one pixel stroke and set that to inside which it already is by default, and
</text>
<text start="21079.15" dur="5.02">
we&#39;re going to add the surfaces overlay color to the stroke but I&#39;m going to remove that
</text>
<text start="21084.17" dur="4.872">
color style right there. And I&#39;m going to go to surfaces Overlay and
</text>
<text start="21089.042" dur="7.5">
I now have that specified and if that icon placeholders too hard to see we can change
</text>
<text start="21096.542" dur="6.618">
the color of that. And now we have our action outline chip and
</text>
<text start="21103.16" dur="4.49">
we can go ahead and even add auto layout to this so it the spacing is dynamic, so you
</text>
<text start="21107.65" dur="7.12">
don&#39;t have to manually do this all the time. So I hit shift a to make auto layout and then
</text>
<text start="21114.77" dur="5.58">
I&#39;m going to remove the default horizontal and vertical padding And then realign this
</text>
<text start="21120.35" dur="6.07">
up, you have to realign it when you do that, and then I&#39;m going to go ahead and move that
</text>
<text start="21126.42" dur="2.582">
over, make sure that&#39;s four dips to the left here.
</text>
<text start="21129.002" dur="10.498">
And then we&#39;ll add that to this as well, and remove the, the one pixel padding added and
</text>
<text start="21139.5" dur="7.32">
re realign these elements, which is annoying. And then what I&#39;m going to do is go ahead
</text>
<text start="21146.82" dur="4.65">
and shift click on on both of these in the Layers panel and hit shift a.
</text>
<text start="21151.47" dur="6.402">
And what I&#39;ve essentially done is maintain the spacing between this this these two elements
</text>
<text start="21157.872" dur="5.378">
by creating that parent. And now what I can do is go ahead and select
</text>
<text start="21163.25" dur="5.98">
my action outlined frame the parent frame and hit shift a.
</text>
<text start="21169.23" dur="5.872">
And I can go ahead and specify the spacing for that element as well.
</text>
<text start="21175.102" dur="8.208">
And it will be dynamic, but one thing to note is that this can auto layout can get tricky,
</text>
<text start="21183.31" dur="6.142">
because you can&#39;t individually specify the the spacing.
</text>
<text start="21189.452" dur="6.738">
So if I want this to be 12 on this side, it&#39;s currently not possible to do that thought
</text>
<text start="21196.19" dur="3.15">
all out. So what you can do is just go ahead and undo
</text>
<text start="21199.34" dur="3.282">
those actions. And you may have to manually readjust this.
</text>
<text start="21202.622" dur="6.609">
And we&#39;ll tackle this in the in the next in our next video in our next section of the
</text>
<text start="21209.231" dur="6.259">
course Excuse me. So now that we&#39;ve created this outline action
</text>
<text start="21215.49" dur="11.612">
chip, we can go ahead and duplicate it, and then create that as a main component.
</text>
<text start="21227.102" dur="6.658">
Once that&#39;s specified, we go ahead and start tackling this input chip more is slightly
</text>
<text start="21233.76" dur="9.51">
different, we&#39;re gonna, I&#39;m gonna have to end up removing the auto layout in frames,
</text>
<text start="21243.27" dur="2.772">here. And then.</text>
<text start="21246.042" dur="4.991">
So I was using shortcut key Option Shift a to remove the auto layout and then Command
</text>
<text start="21251.033" dur="5.067">
Shift G to remove the frame. As that is what is left.
</text>
<text start="21256.1" dur="4.182">
Once you create remove auto layout, it turns into a frame and then you have to remove the
</text>
<text start="21260.282" dur="7.25">frame. So with that set, I will label this and put</text>
<text start="21267.532" dur="9.208">
whoops and put ship. All the proper padding has been specified
</text>
<text start="21276.74" dur="6.77">
right now we have that icon placeholder. And now we need to add a an actionable icon
</text>
<text start="21283.51" dur="3.022">
here. And I already have that in here in our design
</text>
<text start="21286.532" dur="8.698">
system library that is called the cancel icon. So I can copy that.
</text>
<text start="21295.23" dur="4.54">
Select your your parent frame, and then paste it in there.
</text>
<text start="21299.77" dur="4.47">
If need be, whoops, I&#39;m going to drag this here.
</text>
<text start="21304.24" dur="6.382">
And I&#39;m going to reset the size to 18 by 18. And go ahead and drag this into this component
</text>
<text start="21310.622" dur="6.75">
and tshirts vertically center and snap that to the right and push that over roughly Yep,
</text>
<text start="21317.372" dur="4.72">
eight dips. And with that specified, we now have our input
</text>
<text start="21322.092" dur="2.138">
chip. But what we&#39;re going to need to do is set
</text>
<text start="21324.23" dur="4.642">
the constraints on this action icon to right in center vertically.
</text>
<text start="21328.872" dur="4.848">
And then I&#39;m going to go ahead and push this content over so that there&#39;s only eight dips
</text>
<text start="21333.72" dur="8.893">
between the text and this action icon. And we&#39;re going to set that icon placeholder
</text>
<text start="21342.613" dur="7.397">
to left and center vertically. And then let set this to left and center vertically.
</text>
<text start="21350.01" dur="9.192">
And then move this over and ensure I have that spacing set appropriately.
</text>
<text start="21359.202" dur="4.66">
So I have eight dips on the left and right of this text.
</text>
<text start="21363.862" dur="4.958">
And one thing I&#39;m missing is a fill. And I need to remove the stroke and add the
</text>
<text start="21368.82" dur="8.722">
surfaces overlay color to this chip. And once I&#39;ve specified that we are now good
</text>
<text start="21377.542" dur="5.75">
to go and we&#39;ve created all of the chip types for our design system.
</text>
<text start="21383.292" dur="9.518">
All we need to do is label this input. And once we specify that we have now created
</text>
<text start="21392.81" dur="4.362">all the main components necessary for our chips.</text>
<text start="21397.172" dur="3.518">
And that is all I have to show you today. Thanks so much for watching, and I&#39;ll catch
</text>
<text start="21400.69" dur="3.03">
you in the next one. I think I almost forgot, in addition to our
</text>
<text start="21403.72" dur="4.052">
autolayout autolab tends to resize the height of your components.
</text>
<text start="21407.772" dur="5.33">
So we want to make sure we go into our components here as we have the proper constraints set.
</text>
<text start="21413.102" dur="5.89">
We want to double check we have the proper constraints set for our components.
</text>
<text start="21418.992" dur="7.728">
And with auto layout specified on some of these components, we&#39;re going to want to resize
</text>
<text start="21426.72" dur="2.322">
some of these elements and ensure they&#39;re good to go.
</text>
<text start="21429.042" dur="6.5">
Just make sure that&#39;s set to 32 is the height for all of these chips are set to 32.
</text>
<text start="21435.542" dur="5.14">
And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and do the same thing for the rest of these components.
</text>
<text start="21440.682" dur="7.998">
And since the constraints are set to center vertically, they will dynamically adjust properly.
</text>
<text start="21448.68" dur="6.64">
And some of these have auto layout. So I can&#39;t just manually adjust the height
</text>
<text start="21455.32" dur="7.302">
with auto layout implemented. So what I can do is, is remove that auto layout
</text>
<text start="21462.622" dur="6.768">
and readjust that height. And do the same thing here with this component.
</text>
<text start="21469.39" dur="5.812">
Notice that when I remove the auto layout, you can&#39;t see it, I&#39;m using a shortcut key
</text>
<text start="21475.202" dur="5.048">
Option Shift a, it preserves the the master I mean main component icon.
</text>
<text start="21480.25" dur="4.043">
But watch, watch this can&#39;t watch the bounds change, I&#39;ll be able to change the height
</text>
<text start="21484.293" dur="4.017">
after this. So I just hit Option Shift a, it&#39;s now changed
</text>
<text start="21488.31" dur="4.78">
the bounding box, and I&#39;m going to go ahead and crease that by one pixel on each side.
</text>
<text start="21493.09" dur="6.13">
All the spacing is maintained and whatnot, and we are good to go.
</text>
<text start="21499.22" dur="3.51">
We&#39;ll be building out dialogues. And we&#39;re gonna start off with understanding
</text>
<text start="21502.73" dur="3.48">
what dialogues are and how they&#39;re used and why.
</text>
<text start="21506.21" dur="2.55">
And we&#39;re going to build out variants of that dialogue.
</text>
<text start="21508.76" dur="4.05">
And I&#39;ll also challenge you to building out some variants as well, I have all the screenshots
</text>
<text start="21512.81" dur="4.86">
here specified of the barriers we&#39;ll be making. And then we&#39;ll go ahead and just dig into
</text>

the documentation by opening this link. Once you have that open here you can see that
</text>
<text start="21522.5" dur="5.74">
dialogues inform users about a task and contain critical information and require decisions
</text>
<text start="21528.24" dur="7.66">
or involve multiple tasks within that dialog. So here, we can see that this dialogue is
</text>
<text start="21535.9" dur="4.17">
triggered based on a button right. And you&#39;ll notice that there&#39;s this background
</text>
<text start="21540.07" dur="5.202">
overlay, we that&#39;s called a scrim. And we have that in our design system as a
</text>
<text start="21545.272" dur="5.058">
color style not only as a color style, but scrim that we can pull from our system.
</text>
<text start="21550.33" dur="3.42">
So if we go to our figma file, let&#39;s just enable that here.
</text>
<text start="21553.75" dur="6.24">
For go access our team library modal turn on the material design system library, I could
</text>
<text start="21559.99" dur="5.132">
go ahead and search for scrim and we already have it accessible, we can drag and drop it
</text>
<text start="21565.122" dur="4.98">
here to utilize later. So that is a scrim for you and used in this
</text>
<text start="21570.102" dur="2.5">
context. And then you can see that there&#39;s some elevation
</text>
<text start="21572.602" dur="5.01">
around the edges of this dialog being used. And there&#39;s a divider, and in this in this
</text>
<text start="21577.612" dur="6.738">
confirmation variant, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s this menu with some content overflowing.
</text>
<text start="21584.35" dur="3.46">
So we&#39;ll go ahead and build out this this variant.
</text>
<text start="21587.81" dur="5.282">
And we&#39;ll go ahead and build out a what is labeled a simple dialog here in this interactive
</text>
<text start="21593.092" dur="5.338">
demo, where we have list items here. And you&#39;ll notice that the states of these
</text>
<text start="21598.43" dur="2.63">
do not spam the entire width of the dialog, which is interesting.
</text>
<text start="21601.06" dur="5.28">
So if we were to inspect the code, you&#39;ll see that this this is a list item.
</text>
<text start="21606.34" dur="5.38">
And there&#39;s some some padding set to 16 on the left and right of this element.
</text>
<text start="21611.72" dur="5.64">
So that is important to note there. And on top of that in the parent element,
</text>
<text start="21617.36" dur="4.392">
there is a padding of eight on the left and right as well.
</text>
<text start="21621.752" dur="6.16">
So that is padding on the left and right of this dialog that is not applying to the list
</text>
<text start="21627.912" dur="3.018">
items. So that&#39;s why there&#39;s there the the state
</text>
<text start="21630.93" dur="3.09">
there is not taking up the full width of that element.
</text>
<text start="21634.02" dur="6.38">
I&#39;m going to close that Inspect Element. And now we also have an alert dialog variant
</text>
<text start="21640.4" dur="4.71">
as well, which we&#39;ll be building. And not only are there those variants for
</text>
<text start="21645.11" dur="5.342">
that, but you see there&#39;s one with just body copy, just text and with the title.
</text>
<text start="21650.452" dur="5.378">
Or, you know, we have the buttons side by side or we have the option to have two buttons
</text>
<text start="21655.83" dur="2.83">
stacked. To me, I prefer the side by side variant that
</text>
<text start="21658.66" dur="4.49">
seems to be a much more common pattern utilized. And you&#39;ll see that there are other options
</text>
<text start="21663.15" dur="4.462">
as well in this dialog, not for simple, but for the confirmation.
</text>
<text start="21667.612" dur="5.118">
There&#39;s the stacked variant of buttons as well and side by side.
</text>
<text start="21672.73" dur="5.54">
And we&#39;re gonna just go ahead and kind of just understand the usage.
</text>
<text start="21678.27" dur="5.83">
So a dialog is a type of modal window that appears in front of an application or app
</text>
<text start="21684.1" dur="5.97">
content right to provide critical information or ask for decision dialog, disable all app
</text>
<text start="21690.07" dur="5.94">
functionality when they appear and remain on screen until confirmed dismissed or a required
</text>
<text start="21696.01" dur="5.65">
action has been taken. And these are purposely interruptive which
</text>
<text start="21701.66" dur="7.122">
is which refers back to how this is displayed in front of app content is purposely interruptive.
</text>
<text start="21708.782" dur="4.26">
So they should be used sparingly. And there&#39;s some principles around this component
</text>
<text start="21713.042" dur="4.391">
where it is focused. It focuses the user attention to ensure their
</text>
<text start="21717.433" dur="4.349">
content is addressed at that point in time quickly.
</text>
<text start="21721.782" dur="4.91">
Dialogue should be direct and communication, in communicating information and dedicated
</text>
<text start="21726.692" dur="4.948">
to completing a task, dialogue should appear in response to a user task or an action with
</text>
<text start="21731.64" dur="4.862">
relevant or contextual information. So it is very helpful and direct.
</text>
<text start="21736.502" dur="4.798">
And here, you can see when to use either a snack bar banner or dialogue and way dialogue
</text>
<text start="21741.3" dur="7.17">
is used when these these, the the task at hand needs to be very focused in this is considered
</text>
<text start="21748.47" dur="6.1">
high priority. So it blocks the app content below it until
</text>
<text start="21754.57" dur="6.02">
the user takes the actions on the dialog or exits the dialog if the options available.
</text>
<text start="21760.59" dur="4.092">
And here you can see some examples there on mobile and, and the anatomy breakdown.
</text>
<text start="21764.682" dur="5.758">
We&#39;ve got the container title here, some supporting text and the buttons and the scrim in the
</text>
<text start="21770.44" dur="1.36">
background which we&#39;ve already pulled in their finger file.
</text>
<text start="21771.8" dur="4.92">
And we got some specs down here, we&#39;re gonna just go ahead and dive right in and start
</text>
<text start="21776.72" dur="4.732">
building some of these elements out. So we can go ahead and start with the desktop
</text>
<text start="21781.452" dur="3.678">
mobile alerts. So I&#39;m going to grab this here, I&#39;ve already
</text>
<text start="21785.13" dur="2.6">had these labeled to place in our sticker sheet.</text>
<text start="21787.73" dur="4.98">
And what I&#39;m going to do is select these images, move them over.
</text>
<text start="21792.71" dur="6.472">
Here, I&#39;ve referenced the typestyles as well, so we know what to utilize.
</text>
<text start="21799.182" dur="6.058">
And with this specified, I&#39;m going to set the width to 560 dips, and with the width
</text>
<text start="21805.24" dur="6.11">
specified properly, I&#39;m gonna set the height to 182 dips and uses a corner radius of four
</text>
<text start="21811.35" dur="4.56">dips. And then it uses the color surfaces surface</text>
<text start="21815.91" dur="6.05">
for the background, the fill, and then of course utilizes the effect style of elevation
</text>
<text start="21821.96" dur="4.54">
of 24 dip there. And now we have the baseline specified, we&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="21826.5" dur="5.13">
go ahead and rename this component to desktop, forward slash mobile alert as that is the
</text>
<text start="21831.63" dur="7.02">
dialog variant label material design. And we&#39;re gonna go ahead and create an H six.
</text>
<text start="21838.65" dur="5.802">
With an H six created, I&#39;m going to label this dialog header as specified in the file
</text>
<text start="21844.452" dur="5.21">
there in the screenshot, set the autos, the sizing to auto width, the resizing, go ahead
</text>
<text start="21849.662" dur="5.158">
and select my h six. And with that specify, we can go ahead and
</text>
<text start="21854.82" dur="7.49">
rock and roll here, I&#39;m gonna snap this to the top and, and left, so it&#39;s 24 dips from
</text>
<text start="21862.31" dur="6">
the left and the baseline set to 40, which I believe is 24 minutes from the top as well.
</text>
<text start="21868.31" dur="4.812">
And we can go ahead and double check that here by just creating a rectangle and pushing
</text>
<text start="21873.122" dur="3.42">
this content down. So the baseline supposedly set to 40.
</text>
<text start="21876.542" dur="3.338">
So I actually need to go ahead and push this up a bit.
</text>
<text start="21879.88" dur="6.662">
And in turn making that padding 21 dips from the top there with the baseline set to 40.
</text>
<text start="21886.542" dur="5.228">
As you can see. So now that that is specified, we go ahead
</text>
<text start="21891.77" dur="7.652">
and specify our color style for that header. And go in to our color styles, text and iconography
</text>
<text start="21899.422" dur="6.968">
and select the high emphasis color style, we&#39;ll go ahead and duplicate that text and
</text>
<text start="21906.39" dur="6.962">
select the body one color textile. And now we have the proper textile set, we
</text>
<text start="21913.352" dur="3.93">
need to specify the color style to medium emphasis.
</text>
<text start="21917.282" dur="7">
And what we can do essentially is specify the bounding box of this.
</text>
<text start="21924.282" dur="7.468">
And by specifying the bounding box here, I&#39;m going to go ahead and start to just pay attention
</text>
<text start="21931.75" dur="3.65">
the specs. And the baseline is supposed to set to 36
</text>
<text start="21935.4" dur="7.91">
dips from the baseline of the header. So we could essentially just do that create
</text>
<text start="21943.31" dur="7.2">
a whoops, create a push this rectangle down to the baseline, set that to 36 here.
</text>
<text start="21950.51" dur="7.442">
So I just need to push this content up a tad. So now the baseline set to 36 there.
</text>
<text start="21957.952" dur="6.84">
And the bounding box here set to 24 bits on the left and right of this text box.
</text>
<text start="21964.792" dur="6.018">
So what I can do is address this to be a fixed text box.
</text>
<text start="21970.81" dur="4.722">
And that&#39;s currently at 23. Let me push that three pixels.
</text>
<text start="21975.532" dur="2.92">
And now it&#39;s at 24. And we want to set the constraints to left
</text>
<text start="21978.452" dur="3.47">
and right so I&#39;m holding Shift and selecting that right constraint.
</text>
<text start="21981.922" dur="9.788">
And then what we can do is if I keep typing lorem ipsum to lorcet Matt, and just keep
</text>
<text start="21991.71" dur="7.42">
on typing and a new line will appear. So with that new line appearing, we&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="21999.13" dur="6.45">
to go we now just need to justify that the art we need to have we need to justify our
</text>
<text start="22005.58" dur="9.212">
text buttons here. And our text buttons will potentially be 28
</text>
<text start="22014.792" dur="5.538">
dips from the baseline from the bottom here. From The container.
</text>
<text start="22020.33" dur="6.51">
So here, what I&#39;m trying to explain is that the height of this bottom portion of the dialog
</text>
<text start="22026.84" dur="2.77">
is emphasized. So it&#39;s essentially in, you could think of
</text>
<text start="22029.61" dur="6.15">
it as being in its own row, where the content being the buttons within this bottom row here,
</text>
<text start="22035.76" dur="5.29">
almost like the footer of this dialog utilizes two buttons, and the height set to 52.
</text>
<text start="22041.05" dur="4.91">
And it&#39;s centered within that, that bottom row there.
</text>
<text start="22045.96" dur="8.12">
And this text is essentially what the saying is that this body copy is 28 dips from the
</text>
<text start="22054.08" dur="6.26">
from the baseline of the text here, you see that distance from here to that that container
</text>
<text start="22060.34" dur="4.702">row. So to really get that precise, what we can</text>
<text start="22065.042" dur="5.638">
do is I&#39;m going to create a frame here, you could call this dialogue, you could you we
</text>
<text start="22070.68" dur="5.672">
all reference this as footer, and I&#39;m going to specify the height there to 52 dips.
</text>
<text start="22076.352" dur="6.25">
And of course, snap that to the left and bottom, it&#39;s going to hold command and stretch that
</text>
<text start="22082.602" dur="5.448">
out and specify the constraints there to bottom left and right.
</text>
<text start="22088.05" dur="5.902">
And we there&#39;s no need for a background. And we need to implement buttons into this.
</text>
<text start="22093.952" dur="4.57">
So if we grab open our team library, go to text button.
</text>
<text start="22098.522" dur="6.02">
If I type in button, I got my text button there, and it&#39;s labeled in the spec of action
</text>
<text start="22104.542" dur="4.268">one. And I duplicate that, and it&#39;s eight dips</text>
<text start="22108.81" dur="8.41">
away from this button, and then modify that text to say action to we are rocking and rolling,
</text>
<text start="22117.22" dur="7.072">
go ahead and bring this in and actually just drag this into that row and specify see how
</text>
<text start="22124.292" dur="6.469">
it is center aligned that So essentially, our spacing is all proper, good to go, we
</text>
<text start="22130.761" dur="3.83">
have the proper spacing there, eight dips between the two buttons, and to the right
</text>
<text start="22134.591" dur="4.181">
and the bottom, and the top. And because of the height being specified
</text>
<text start="22138.772" dur="3.42">
to 52 for that bottom footer, and we&#39;re good to go.
</text>
<text start="22142.192" dur="7.35">
And all we need to do is really just justify the distance here between here and so 28.
</text>
<text start="22149.542" dur="8.66">
So we&#39;re essentially to two pixels off, supposedly, but this is accurate enough.
</text>
<text start="22158.202" dur="7.548">
And it is 23 degrees away from from there the text box, and we can go ahead and modify
</text>
<text start="22165.75" dur="1.44">that. So it&#39;s set to 24.</text>
<text start="22167.19" dur="6.46">
For now, it&#39;s 2024 dips away, and we are good to go.
</text>
<text start="22173.65" dur="5.65">
This is all properly spaced. And we now have this mobile alert dialog variant,
</text>
<text start="22179.3" dur="4.83">
which is up to spec and we can make that a master component.
</text>
<text start="22184.13" dur="4.412">
Before I do, I&#39;m going to duplicate that. And it&#39;s a main component, I apologize.
</text>
<text start="22188.542" dur="3.75">
So we have our main component variant. I&#39;m going to drag that in here.
</text>
<text start="22192.292" dur="7.538">
And now that we have our main component variant, I&#39;m going to go ahead and see what we&#39;ll tackle
</text>
<text start="22199.83" dur="3.662">
next, what should we tackle next? Well, we can go ahead and create this confirmation
</text>
<text start="22203.492" dur="6.358">
dialog with actions. Nothing too special about this.
</text>
<text start="22209.85" dur="5.83">
The width isn&#39;t actually specified in this and it would kind of just be tedious to build
</text>
<text start="22215.68" dur="3.57">that one out. So let&#39;s start with this one.</text>
<text start="22219.25" dur="5.32">
Actually, not we do have all the details necessary disregard what I stated, we&#39;re going to build
</text>
<text start="22224.57" dur="6.23">
up the mobile confirmation dialog. So I&#39;m going to copy that there.
</text>
<text start="22230.8" dur="5.61">
Go ahead and rename this. Now that I&#39;ve renamed it, I need to specify
</text>
<text start="22236.41" dur="2.542">the width. And we have the two actions.</text>
<text start="22238.952" dur="5.49">
And what we can do is this will resize because we have the constraints set properly.
</text>
<text start="22244.442" dur="3.97">
And we need to set constraints to both these buttons.
</text>
<text start="22248.412" dur="4.138">
And these buttons currently are, are snapped to the top and left of its parent frame, but
</text>
<text start="22252.55" dur="4.56">
we need to snap to the bottom and right so when it resizes it will resize properly.
</text>
<text start="22257.11" dur="6.77">
So what we can do is we have all the property specified properly.
</text>
<text start="22263.88" dur="4.912">
So we&#39;re good to go. All we have to do is set the width from 560
</text>
<text start="22268.792" dur="4.348">
dips to 280 dips, and look at that we have everything constrained proportionately.
</text>
<text start="22273.14" dur="3.32">
The only thing is we need to push this content down.
</text>
<text start="22276.46" dur="7.51">
And with that content pushed down with the content pushed down, we should just specify
</text>
<text start="22283.97" dur="3.572">
the spacing between this text and the the footer row.
</text>
<text start="22287.542" dur="2.91">
And as you can see it&#39;s 28 pips away from the baseline.
</text>
<text start="22290.452" dur="5.848">
So let&#39;s go ahead and ensure that that is implemented properly.
</text>
<text start="22296.3" dur="6.271">
It&#39;s going to change that to 28. And what we&#39;re going to do is make sure that
</text>
<text start="22302.571" dur="8.309">
when we resize this, this parent frame is a set a ruler here within this frame right
</text>
<text start="22310.88" dur="4.37">
here. So as I resize it, I know that it as I resize
</text>
<text start="22315.25" dur="7.24">
the parent frame, I know I need to push this up one more pixel, I was hoping that that
</text>
<text start="22322.49" dur="6.092">
red line would help me align the content, but it does not actually do that it&#39;s not
</text>
<text start="22328.582" dur="5.168">responsive, those red lines, they stay in place.</text>
<text start="22333.75" dur="10.85">
And then I&#39;m going to drag this text box down and ensure that that&#39;s set to 24.
</text>
<text start="22344.6" dur="4.28">
So there we go, that that proper spacing there on the left and right and bottom.
</text>
<text start="22348.88" dur="3.46">
And we now have our confirmation dialog variant there.
</text>
<text start="22352.34" dur="7.252">And again, this is adhering to a one line variant.</text>
<text start="22359.592" dur="4.838">
There&#39;s also this is also indicating a two line dialog header there with two lines.
</text>
<text start="22364.43" dur="4.49">
So we could even go ahead and do that if we wanted to.
</text>
<text start="22368.92" dur="5.702">
So I can go ahead and do that real quick. So we will have to push down this content
</text>
<text start="22374.622" dur="6.028">
essentially. So with that, I&#39;m going to just push this
</text>
<text start="22380.65" dur="8.06">
copy down. And then right to bash line dialog header,
</text>
<text start="22388.71" dur="6.72">
we now have our two line, I&#39;m going to push this up to 14, because that gives me the proper
</text>
<text start="22395.43" dur="7.99">
spacing here. of 36 dips there, from from one baseline to
</text>
<text start="22403.42" dur="4.18">
another. So that&#39;s set to 36, as I&#39;ve stated, which
</text>
<text start="22407.6" dur="4.602">
is awesome. So that&#39;s properly, proportionately implemented.
</text>
<text start="22412.202" dur="6.92">
And now I just need to justify the spacing of between this text and the actions.
</text>
<text start="22419.122" dur="6.178">
So that&#39;s set to 28 depth, so we can do is, this should be much easier is actually go
</text>
<text start="22425.3" dur="8.1">
ahead and put push this content, create that 28 dip rectangle to align things, and just
</text>
<text start="22433.4" dur="3.723">push this up for four dips there, and delete it.</text>
<text start="22437.123" dur="2.499">
And now our baselines are aligned as specified in the spec.
</text>
<text start="22439.622" dur="6.318">
And what I can do is select Resize to Fit or the shortcut key Shift Option command R.
</text>
<text start="22445.94" dur="5.38">
And that should resize the content to the parent container, which is awesome.
</text>
<text start="22451.32" dur="5.76">
Or you can just hold down Command until it until it snaps to your container.
</text>
<text start="22457.08" dur="5.16">And you now have your two two line dialog header.</text>
<text start="22462.24" dur="7.712">
And we can go ahead and create this confirmation dialog with long actions that are stacked.
</text>
<text start="22469.952" dur="5.408">
So the difference between this one is that these buttons are side by side.
</text>
<text start="22475.36" dur="6.54">
And these are stack. And all we have to do is we&#39;re not to do a
</text>
<text start="22481.9" dur="8.342">
little more moving around here. So they&#39;re in this scenario, there&#39;s the concept
</text>
<text start="22490.242" dur="6.04">
of the footer doesn&#39;t need to be utilized, it could be where I&#39;m going to remove that.
</text>
<text start="22496.282" dur="9.01">
And what I&#39;m going to do is rename this to turn on speed boost.
</text>
<text start="22505.292" dur="7.07">
And with that specified, I&#39;m just gonna align these properly.
</text>
<text start="22512.362" dur="13.108">
And then make sure they&#39;re 12 dips in distance apart, and make sure that
</text>
<text start="22525.47" dur="10.822">
they&#39;re dips from the right of this frame. So it&#39;s a ditch in the right and should be
</text>
<text start="22536.292" dur="5.718">
depth from the bottom as well. So now that we have that specified, we have
</text>
<text start="22542.01" dur="7.3">
our two buttons. But what we need to know is the baseline.
</text>
<text start="22549.31" dur="10.12">
So 828, so 36 dips from the frame here. So when you specify 36 dips from the frame,
</text>
<text start="22559.43" dur="7.43">
essentially what I did was I just calculated the distance, the distance from this baseline,
</text>
<text start="22566.86" dur="5.94">
and the distance from this between this button and here, and that&#39;s 28 plus eight, which
</text>
<text start="22572.8" dur="6.452">
is 36 five, if I&#39;m doing my math, right, and I can just go ahead and drag this up till
</text>
<text start="22579.252" dur="3.328">it snaps there. And we&#39;re aligned.</text>
<text start="22582.58" dur="5.03">
So I am that appropriate spacing. And now all I need to do is make sure I drag
</text>
<text start="22587.61" dur="4.98">
up the bottom of this element. So that is eight depth from the bottom of
</text>
<text start="22592.59" dur="4.172">
the button. And I could apply my constraints 30 set properly
</text>
<text start="22596.762" dur="8.44">
and we are good to go. I&#39;m going to specify that this is a confirmation
</text>
<text start="22605.202" dur="7.768">
dialog with long actions. I&#39;m going to make that a main component and
</text>
<text start="22612.97" dur="9.69">
next up we can create the mobile alert dialog I just attached my instance, label this alert
</text>
<text start="22622.66" dur="3.56">dialog. And the alert dialog is very simple.</text>
<text start="22626.22" dur="3.59">
It doesn&#39;t even have a header, it just utilizes body copy.
</text>
<text start="22629.81" dur="7.16">
So what we can go ahead and do is add 52 plus 28 plus 38.
</text>
<text start="22636.97" dur="12.312">
Whoops, you can&#39;t do math 28 plus 38. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s not doing the math for
</text>
<text start="22649.282" dur="6.038">me there. So 28 plus 3866 plus 52, that&#39;s 118.</text>
<text start="22655.32" dur="5.632">So the height of this element is going to be 118.</text>
<text start="22660.952" dur="13.348">
So what we can do is just set this to 118. And now we can put this text, push this text
</text>
<text start="22674.3" dur="6.5">
up, just make it one line. And now that we have that one line, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="22680.8" dur="7.55">
to set the typography to resize the width, automatically, I&#39;ll then ensure that the baseline
</text>
<text start="22688.35" dur="7.262">
is set appropriately. So it&#39;s set to currently 38 dips from from
</text>
<text start="22695.612" dur="3.108">the top right now it&#39;s 40. There we go at 38.</text>
<text start="22698.72" dur="4.53">There, I can push this content up, excuse me.</text>
<text start="22703.25" dur="6.06">
And now I can create a fixed text box. And I want it to be 24 dips from the right,
</text>
<text start="22709.31" dur="6.79">or 624. So if I push this in a little more at 22.</text>
<text start="22716.1" dur="6.54">
And now I have it set to 24. And with that specified, I also want the textbox
</text>
<text start="22722.64" dur="6.93">
to be eight dips from the bottom here, I have this from the bottom of the buttons outer
</text>
<text start="22729.57" dur="7.34">frame. So currently, it&#39;s set to four.</text>
<text start="22736.91" dur="2.76">
Now it&#39;s set to eight there, and we&#39;re good to go.
</text>
<text start="22739.67" dur="5.36">
We have all the proper spacing specified for this alert dialog.
</text>
<text start="22745.03" dur="2.232">And we are good to go. That is it.</text>
<text start="22747.262" dur="8.27">
Maybe we can just rename these to cancel and discard.
</text>
<text start="22755.532" dur="4.528">
And what we can do here is just ensure the proper spacing is set to 12 currently set
</text>
<text start="22760.06" dur="4.09">that to eight, and then push this over. For dips.</text>
<text start="22764.15" dur="6.052">
Now it&#39;s properly spaced, eight Between the Buttons and bottom and right of the buttons.
</text>
<text start="22770.202" dur="3.75">
So that&#39;s great. And now we have our mobile variant of our
</text>
<text start="22773.952" dur="4.608">
alert dialog. And now that we&#39;ve created three of these,
</text>
<text start="22778.56" dur="7.972">
I can, I want to challenge you to building out this dialog header here.
</text>
<text start="22786.532" dur="9.448">
And we can see that it uses is, well if we go to our list items, we can easily see that
</text>
<text start="22795.98" dur="7.86">
we could use this variant here that I just pulled the with the icon and text and the
</text>
<text start="22803.84" dur="7.15">
action, which is another icon. And we can resize this accordingly.
</text>
<text start="22810.99" dur="5.29">
We can go ahead and actually build this together by modifying some existing list item components
</text>
<text start="22816.28" dur="7.99">
that we have. So with that said, we have a we&#39;re gonna just
</text>
<text start="22824.27" dur="7.82">
perfect this, this list item here. So we&#39;re gonna label this icon and text, I&#39;ve
</text>
<text start="22832.09" dur="4.352">
got that list item. And of course, we&#39;ve applied constraints already
</text>
<text start="22836.442" dur="2.808">
to this. So it will be worth picking out of the box
</text>
<text start="22839.25" dur="4.86">
because because we&#39;ve already defined that, and we&#39;re just going to set the height of
</text>
<text start="22844.11" dur="7.99">
this 256 dips, content stay centered as needed. And as expected, and then we&#39;ll set the height
</text>
<text start="22852.1" dur="5.772">
of this 240 by 40. But we want the height of the icon to be 40
</text>
<text start="22857.872" dur="4">by 40. So I go ahead and implement this, with the</text>
<text start="22861.872" dur="8.018">
icon currently is set to 33 point 33. So what we can do is I can detach this ungroup
</text>
<text start="22869.89" dur="7.1">
it and I just want to make sure I&#39;m scaling the vector properly.
</text>
<text start="22876.99" dur="8.432">
And the frame set to 40 by 40. As you can see, and we can just use temporarily
</text>
<text start="22885.422" dur="4.281">
we have a placeholder. So if you knew this, actually, you know, refine
</text>
<text start="22889.703" dur="3.559">that icon later on, you can go ahead and do that.</text>
<text start="22893.262" dur="4.69">
But I&#39;m just gonna use this placeholder so not to mess with the modifying the the icons
</text>
<text start="22897.952" dur="3.848">
that are systematically built from. For material design.
</text>
<text start="22901.8" dur="7.68">
I&#39;m just gonna change the quarter rate on this icon placeholder so it&#39;s 40 by 40.
</text>
<text start="22909.48" dur="7.5">
And it is 24 dips from the the left of of this list item.
</text>
<text start="22916.98" dur="2.23">
So now that I&#39;ve moved that column That&#39;s great.
</text>
<text start="22919.21" dur="5.712">
And the text is 20 dips to the left of, of the the icon as well.
</text>
<text start="22924.922" dur="3.27">
And I&#39;m going to make sure that constraints are set to left and center vertically.
</text>
<text start="22928.192" dur="5.09">
And the constraints are good to go on this text here.
</text>
<text start="22933.282" dur="8.878">
And all I have to do is, I could rename this here so that the text is matching the, what&#39;s
</text>
<text start="22942.16" dur="5.98">
specified in the spec. And what we can do is just duplicate this
</text>
<text start="22948.14" dur="3.67">
and align this to the bottom of the next list item.
</text>
<text start="22951.81" dur="7.71">
And just label this user two. And then I can duplicate this again, and just
</text>
<text start="22959.52" dur="5.83">
type an ad account. And feel free to modify the fill of this and
</text>
<text start="22965.35" dur="7.76">
change that to the image type and add an image as needed.
</text>
<text start="22973.11" dur="4.53">
As it utilizes icons, there are now that the spacing specified on these three list items,
</text>
<text start="22977.64" dur="5.87">
let&#39;s go ahead and make the parent container. So our parent container, I would imagine is
</text>
<text start="22983.51" dur="6.58">
set to Well, in this case set to 320, or two at a specified here.
</text>
<text start="22990.09" dur="2.63">
And that seems like the same width as a simple dialog.
</text>
<text start="22992.72" dur="9.79">
So I&#39;m going to create a frame, go to my sticker sheet and copy that naming convention.
</text>
<text start="23002.51" dur="8.662">
and rename this to the mobile slash simple dialogue, that the width to 280 corner radius
</text>
<text start="23011.172" dur="8.28">
to four color style the filter surfaces surface and then the effects to the have the effect
</text>
<text start="23019.452" dur="6.55">
style of utilizing elevation of 24 dips. And with that, we&#39;re going to modify the width
</text>
<text start="23026.002" dur="8.988">here to whoops, the width is should be good to go.</text>
<text start="23034.99" dur="9.72">
What we&#39;re going to do is add a an H six here, what I can do is just copy the H six here.
</text>
<text start="23044.71" dur="5.69">
And then or I can grab this one liner h6 that I&#39;ve already created.
</text>
<text start="23050.4" dur="6.44">
And they will position it within this element. And we need to check and ensure that the baseline
</text>
<text start="23056.84" dur="4.612">
of this is set is 40 depths from the top of this frame.
</text>
<text start="23061.452" dur="11.41">
And with that, let&#39;s see, set that to 40. Just push, essentially just pushing that up
</text>
<text start="23072.862" dur="3.458">slightly. And now that is good to go.</text>
<text start="23076.32" dur="8.962">
We have our dialogue header and is wrapped in a a frame that has a height of 64.
</text>
<text start="23085.282" dur="4.848">
So I&#39;m going to set the vertical constraint to center on the text.
</text>
<text start="23090.13" dur="4.292">
So when I resize the frame I just wrapped it in it will stay in position as needed.
</text>
<text start="23094.422" dur="6.28">
So it&#39;s set to 60. Now it&#39;s set to 60 for the height set to 64
</text>
<text start="23100.702" dur="2.39">dips, and it did not properly do what I wanted it.</text>
<text start="23103.092" dur="5.129">
So I&#39;m going to make sure it&#39;s centered within that frame, then push that to the top, hold
</text>
<text start="23108.221" dur="7.199">
down Command and resize this header frame header, I&#39;m going to label that header.
</text>
<text start="23115.42" dur="5.59">
Now I have that set properly. And then all these list items will stack on
</text>
<text start="23121.01" dur="6.411">
top of this frame. So I can now that they&#39;re stacked, these are
</text>
<text start="23127.421" dur="2.771">
appropriately sized, I just need to adjust the width.
</text>
<text start="23130.192" dur="6.498">
And we&#39;re good to go. All I need to do is justify resizing this
</text>
<text start="23136.69" dur="11.8">
bottom portion. And I may need to add 16 dips there, the bottom
</text>
<text start="23148.49" dur="9.95">
is currently set to 870 and increase that 17% up one and we&#39;re gonna go.
</text>
<text start="23158.44" dur="5.102">So we now have achieved our simple dialog variant.</text>
<text start="23163.542" dur="4.478">And we have a couple more to create if we want.</text>
<text start="23168.02" dur="6.732">
I&#39;m actually going to challenge you to building out the last two elements.
</text>
<text start="23174.752" dur="6.77">
And what you&#39;re going to find yourself doing in creating these last two is we&#39;ve created
</text>
<text start="23181.522" dur="4.77">
these four together. But in these dialogues, you&#39;re going to find
</text>
<text start="23186.292" dur="7">
yourself building out some complex dialogues here, you&#39;re going to come across this, these
</text>
<text start="23193.292" dur="6.698">
items or the items overflow and are are being hidden because of the overflow because we
</text>
<text start="23199.99" dur="5.07">
have this, these actions appearing above and the user can scroll through these items and
</text>
<text start="23205.06" dur="2.75">
select one. So I&#39;m going to challenge you to building
</text>
<text start="23207.81" dur="6.032">
that and also challenge you to building out this fullscreen dialog.
</text>
<text start="23213.842" dur="3.95">
What you&#39;re not building are these text input fields in the interface.
</text>
<text start="23217.792" dur="8.528">
You could But for the fullscreen dialog, we might, that&#39;s just a bonus for you to create,
</text>
<text start="23226.32" dur="5.372">
and challenge yourself. And, yeah, I&#39;m just gonna pause this video
</text>
<text start="23231.692" dur="2.148">and build out this scrolling confirmation dialog.</text>
<text start="23233.84" dur="5.782">
And I&#39;ll be right back. So I&#39;ve now built out my scrolling confirmation
</text>
<text start="23239.622" dur="4.82">
dialog variant for mobile. And essentially what I did was I just recreated
</text>
<text start="23244.442" dur="5.968">
it, let me go ahead and grab it. So our other mobile variant, our simple dialogue,
</text>
<text start="23250.41" dur="8.42">
what I did was I copied this, detached it. And I went to my assets and grabbed my radio
</text>
<text start="23258.83" dur="5.282">
checklists, Marriott. And then I wrapped that in a frame, I set
</text>
<text start="23264.112" dur="5.98">
the height, as you can see here, to 48. And I just specified the proper spacing between
</text>
<text start="23270.092" dur="4.308">
all the elements within this list item, then I just duplicated them.
</text>
<text start="23274.4" dur="2.52">
And they were because they&#39;re supposed to stack on top of each other.
</text>
<text start="23276.92" dur="8.26">
And since our buttons are labeled properly, I was able to just swap them between the two
</text>
<text start="23285.18" dur="5.54">
states, which was awesome, set the constraints to vertically, be centered if this height
</text>
<text start="23290.72" dur="7.26">
ever gets modified. And then I grabbed the footer here, and move
</text>
<text start="23297.98" dur="3.702">
that to the top of the layer order. So it looked like it looks like you&#39;re able
</text>
<text start="23301.682" dur="4.638">to scroll through this content, as indicated here.</text>
<text start="23306.32" dur="5.24">
And this footer was already created, all I had to do was add a divider into this element.
</text>
<text start="23311.56" dur="5.86">
And I snap that divider to the top here in the footer element in the footer frame.
</text>
<text start="23317.42" dur="5.91">
And that&#39;s all I had to do. And that&#39;s how I created that dialogue there.
</text>
<text start="23323.33" dur="4.462">
And yeah, that was how I built that. And that is all I have to show you today and
</text>
<text start="23327.792" dur="3.458">
building out dialogues. I hope you learned a lot and enjoyed this
</text>
<text start="23331.25" dur="3.69">
video. And I challenge you as a bonus to create this
</text>
<text start="23334.94" dur="7.36">
fullscreen dialogue. We are going to be going over date pickers
</text>
<text start="23342.3" dur="3.8">
and we&#39;re going to gain a general overview of what date pickers that are out there and
</text>
<text start="23346.1" dur="3.57">
when and how they&#39;re used. And then we&#39;re going to build out some date
</text>
<text start="23349.67" dur="3.04">
pickers ourselves. And here we have the documentation.
</text>
<text start="23352.71" dur="6.95">
And I&#39;m gonna go ahead and open the link. And once your link opens, as you can see,
</text>
<text start="23359.66" dur="5.49">
date pickers let users select a date or a range of dates, as you can see here.
</text>
<text start="23365.15" dur="4.37">
This specifies the current date and then the selected date here.
</text>
<text start="23369.52" dur="4.422">
And we have a header little edit icon to edit the date from this field here, this header,
</text>
<text start="23373.942" dur="8.228">
drop down menu there and some some arrows to move between months.
</text>
<text start="23382.17" dur="2.17">
and serve. There&#39;s some elevation being utilized.
</text>
<text start="23384.34" dur="6.69">
And here&#39;s a breakdown of the anatomy of a mobile calendar date picker.
</text>
<text start="23391.03" dur="7.29">
And here you can see that it has a title up above and then the selected date here being
</text>
<text start="23398.32" dur="4">
represented. And then it has the switch to keyboard input
</text>
<text start="23402.32" dur="6.33">
icon, which is what this is called. And then it has the year selection menu.
</text>
<text start="23408.65" dur="5.76">
And we also have the the pagination for going from month to month either forward or backwards.
</text>
<text start="23414.41" dur="4.85">
And then we have the current date here. This is represented with this outline.
</text>
<text start="23419.26" dur="7.75">
And then we have the selected date here with a primary color as the background specified,
</text>
<text start="23427.01" dur="6.32">
and some actions there to cancel or hit OK. And you can see what the mobile date range
</text>
<text start="23433.33" dur="3.16">
picker looks like. So here&#39;s a mobile calendar date picker.
</text>
<text start="23436.49" dur="5.01">
So this is a calendar date picker. And then we have the date range picker.
</text>
<text start="23441.5" dur="5.84">So you can specify a start date and a end date.</text>
<text start="23447.34" dur="5.952">
And then this is the selected range here with the lighter primary color in the background.
</text>
<text start="23453.292" dur="6.148">
Then we have a mobile input picker variant, bunch of breakdowns of the anatomy there,
</text>
<text start="23459.44" dur="4.9">
and whatnot. And this video is going to be very dense.
</text>
<text start="23464.34" dur="5.6">
There&#39;s a lot of things going on in this date picker component, and we&#39;re going to do, we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="23469.94" dur="4.172">
going to break it down, we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re really going to simplify it and start off
</text>
<text start="23474.112" dur="8.488">
with the little elements that it&#39;s composed of, and then build out those elements accordingly.
</text>
<text start="23482.6" dur="6.36">
And with that mental model in mind, we&#39;ll be able to tackle building out these complex
</text>
<text start="23488.96" dur="2.85">components. So that is awesome.</text>
<text start="23491.81" dur="4.88">
And we&#39;re going to be building out not only mobile variants, but also desktop variants.
</text>
<text start="23496.69" dur="5.44">
So that that&#39;s great. and here if we go to our specs, you can see
</text>
<text start="23502.13" dur="5.072">
that that we have touch targets specified for a mobile date picker, where the touch
</text>
<text start="23507.202" dur="7.648">
target size for a date picker is set to 32 by 32 dips.
</text>
<text start="23514.85" dur="8.06">
And that the this is the recommended approach here And the outer container is set to 40
</text>
<text start="23522.91" dur="3.85">
by 48 nips. And here we&#39;re starting to see the specs of
</text>
<text start="23526.76" dur="5.31">
what the calendar header looks like here. So that is very important.
</text>
<text start="23532.07" dur="6.18">
And a bunch of specs specified to right there, so you don&#39;t miss anything, since there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="23538.25" dur="5.13">
a lot going on. And here you can see a calendar view for the
</text>
<text start="23543.38" dur="7.61">
mobile date picker, and a year selection view. So on and so forth, we&#39;re going to be covering
</text>
<text start="23550.99" dur="4.952">
these heavily in figma. So let&#39;s jump right into it.
</text>
<text start="23555.942" dur="4.728">
So here, I have a, our soon to be sticker sheet here.
</text>
<text start="23560.67" dur="2.24">
And here&#39;s a couple of elements we&#39;ll be building out.
</text>
<text start="23562.91" dur="6.55">
So we have the mobile calendar header right here that we&#39;re going to build out, and our
</text>
<text start="23569.46" dur="4.79">
mobile calendar picker tool, calendar picker image here to reference.
</text>
<text start="23574.25" dur="5.86">
So I&#39;m gonna move some of these images out of the way.
</text>
<text start="23580.11" dur="7.72">
So just keep these here, push this image up. And with that, we can go ahead and get started.
</text>
<text start="23587.83" dur="6.831">
So I&#39;m gonna go ahead and copy this, this text, because that&#39;s going to be the name
</text>
<text start="23594.661" dur="6.729">
of our main component once it&#39;s created. And we can go ahead and start to figure out
</text>
<text start="23601.39" dur="7.53">
what the, the width of this calendar view should be in that set to 328 dips.
</text>
<text start="23608.92" dur="5.64">
So we type in 328. We know how the width specified, but what
</text>
<text start="23614.56" dur="5.25">
we need to identify Next is the height of this calendar header.
</text>
<text start="23619.81" dur="10.303">
So here, you can see that it&#39;s set to 120. And then we have 32 plus 24, so 100 and then
</text>
<text start="23630.113" dur="3.089">plus 120. So with that, we get 176.</text>
<text start="23633.202" dur="6.34">
And the height of this is set to 176. And now that we have the height, specified
</text>
<text start="23639.542" dur="6.458">
properly, we&#39;re going to want to also specify the rounded corners on this parent frame.
</text>
<text start="23646" dur="2.83">
So set the rounded corners into an independent corner.
</text>
<text start="23648.83" dur="4.83">
So we&#39;re going to want to set it to the top left and top right, and set that to four.
</text>
<text start="23653.66" dur="8.712">
Now our corners are rounded on the top. And we&#39;re going to need to do is add in overline
</text>
<text start="23662.372" dur="3.678">
text property here. As you can see, the baseline is set to 32
</text>
<text start="23666.05" dur="5.652">dips. So if we go ahead and whoops, pull out our</text>
<text start="23671.702" dur="8.67">
text tool, and just specify select date, and then change the text style to over line, we
</text>
<text start="23680.372" dur="8.898">
now have select date specified and all of our content will be 16 dips to the left, and
</text>
<text start="23689.27" dur="4.33">
ensure are actually 24. My apologies set to 24 dips to the left here
</text>
<text start="23693.6" dur="4.272">
in this header. And then we&#39;re gonna check that baseline.
</text>
<text start="23697.872" dur="6.808">
And sure it&#39;s set to 32. So 30, we&#39;re almost accurate.
</text>
<text start="23704.68" dur="6.772">
So now that we have that set there, the baseline set to 32 are good to go.
</text>
<text start="23711.452" dur="5.218">
And one thing we do need is in this exercise file, here are some icons, I&#39;m going to copy
</text>
<text start="23716.67" dur="6.782">
this edit icon. And I need to place it towards the right of
</text>
<text start="23723.452" dur="5.59">this. This field, so one thing I need to specify</text>
<text start="23729.042" dur="11.028">
is that what I could do is in my in this component, if I named this properly in this element,
</text>
<text start="23740.07" dur="3.95">
which is a calendar header, I can start to wrap these elements accordingly.
</text>
<text start="23744.02" dur="9.67">
So maybe I want to turn this into a frame and label this select date row.
</text>
<text start="23753.69" dur="4.901">
And with this Rowse, I could, what I want to do is make sure that I hold out command
</text>
<text start="23758.591" dur="6.069">
and snap this to and drag this to the top and right edges of the parent frame.
</text>
<text start="23764.66" dur="10.08">
So that way this content is being isolated from the the text field here because you see
</text>
<text start="23774.74" dur="6.59">
this box specified here this entire screen you can think of it as a row when you implement
</text>
<text start="23781.33" dur="5.58">
this in development. And then we have a another row below it with
</text>
<text start="23786.91" dur="3.262">
a big header. So we&#39;ll go ahead and add that I believe that
</text>
<text start="23790.172" dur="4.088">
as an h1, I&#39;m going to specify that exact date, November 17.
</text>
<text start="23794.26" dur="7.68">
On Monday, go to my text styles and select the h1 and it&#39;s clearly not an h1, we&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="23801.94" dur="5.672">
to want to change that to an h3. This looks like it&#39;s actually an h4.
</text>
<text start="23807.612" dur="6.918">
So I&#39;m gonna snap this to the bottom right and what we want to do is make sure that our
</text>
<text start="23814.53" dur="9.52">
text here Is 24 dips from the left. And not only that, we&#39;re gonna have to go
</text>
<text start="23824.05" dur="9.14">
ahead and align our icons here. But on top of that, our typography here, you&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="23833.19" dur="7.092">
notice in this component below, we have another portion of the header that has a white background.
</text>
<text start="23840.282" dur="6.028">
So what we&#39;re going to do is specify the distance here.
</text>
<text start="23846.31" dur="9.87">
So we have 128 72. So we have a distance, I believe I have about
</text>
<text start="23856.18" dur="4.4">roughly 16. Here, it&#39;s not really clear.</text>
<text start="23860.58" dur="11.78">
So if we subtract 72 plus 3200 420, mm is 104, we&#39;re getting 16.
</text>
<text start="23872.36" dur="10.89">
So yes, we want to ensure that we have specified the height of the bottom portion.
</text>
<text start="23883.25" dur="13.52">
So what we can do is if we change this background, or these colors to text, and I cannot content
</text>
<text start="23896.77" dur="5.38">
on primary, and then I can change this to content on primary as well.
</text>
<text start="23902.15" dur="6.78">
And I go ahead and select the background fill of this, the container, the component, and
</text>
<text start="23908.93" dur="5.97">
I select that the primary, all I have to do is I can even duplicate this row, delete the
</text>
<text start="23914.9" dur="10.13">
text in that frame, and, and specify this background to be set to surfaces surface.
</text>
<text start="23925.03" dur="2.9">
And I just need to ensure that the height is set appropriately.
</text>
<text start="23927.93" dur="10.78">
So it&#39;s set to what is that 32 plus 24, which will give us 56, the height set to 56 on this
</text>
<text start="23938.71" dur="3.18">
on this element. And I can just make sure that it snaps to
</text>
<text start="23941.89" dur="3.89">
the bottom there. And with that justified, I just need to make
</text>
<text start="23945.78" dur="12.89">
sure that this typography whoops, this typography, and icon is our our 16 dips from the bottom,
</text>
<text start="23958.67" dur="5.15">
which we have now justified and 24 dips in the left and right.
</text>
<text start="23963.82" dur="10.14">
And as you can see here, whoops, the typography is 64 dips to the left of this icon, which
</text>
<text start="23973.96" dur="4.77">
now that everything is set proportionately, we are good to go.
</text>
<text start="23978.73" dur="6.27">
So I just need to make sure this icon is aligning to the baseline of the type text in this date
</text>
<text start="23985" dur="3.032">picker. So you push that down one pixel.</text>
<text start="23988.032" dur="5.488">And now that is being aligned. So that is great.</text>
<text start="23993.52" dur="5.3">
And we are rocking and rolling. So we&#39;re almost done, we need to go ahead
</text>
<text start="23998.82" dur="7.19">
and build out our typography here. So here you can see that there is padding
</text>
<text start="24006.01" dur="10.002">
on the top and bottom of this section here, this date picker row.
</text>
<text start="24016.012" dur="5.318">
So I can specify that. And once that is specified in this date picker
</text>
<text start="24021.33" dur="4.792">
row, I&#39;m going to need to ensure I have the proper typography specified.
</text>
<text start="24026.122" dur="3.598">
And this looks like it&#39;s utilizing a caption textile.
</text>
<text start="24029.72" dur="7.152">
So this will essentially be centered. And with that caption text text style, notice
</text>
<text start="24036.872" dur="10.17">
type in November 2018. Select my caption text style.
</text>
<text start="24047.042" dur="6.47">
and center it since it&#39;s wrapped in a row that has a height of 56 and specifies that
</text>
<text start="24053.512" dur="5.568">
the baselines 32 pixels from the top of this, I&#39;m just going to center it as it clearly
</text>
<text start="24059.08" dur="6.532">
is centered in this element. Ensure that set to 24 dips in the left.
</text>
<text start="24065.612" dur="9.76">
And we&#39;re also utilizing a a arrow down drop down arrow drop down icon.
</text>
<text start="24075.372" dur="5.108">
So I can copy this here. Go ahead and select this date picker row,
</text>
<text start="24080.48" dur="7.812">
paste it in and start moving this until it is four dips to the left of this text.
</text>
<text start="24088.292" dur="7.25">
So now that that is up to spec here for dips there from left to this text.
</text>
<text start="24095.542" dur="7.388">
And now that that is implemented, we can go ahead and add the icons for moving between
</text>
<text start="24102.93" dur="2.87">months. So I have both of those here.</text>
<text start="24105.8" dur="8.91">
I&#39;m going to copy those and specify the spacing to 24 between the icons and there&#39;s a spacing
</text>
<text start="24114.71" dur="5.93">
of 24 as well right here. So I can actually Just go drag these in here.
</text>
<text start="24120.64" dur="5.66">
And once these are dragged in, just kind of move these elements accordingly.
</text>
<text start="24126.3" dur="5.85">
And now we are good to go, we have created our header.
</text>
<text start="24132.15" dur="7.03">
And we can go ahead and double check spacing as needed there 16 dips sit on top and bottom
</text>
<text start="24139.18" dur="5.5">
between our elements there. And we can even wrap these two together if
</text>
<text start="24144.68" dur="4.57">needed. You can apply constraints and in relation</text>
<text start="24149.25" dur="3.92">
to its parent element. So I&#39;m setting everything here to left and
</text>
<text start="24153.17" dur="5.3">
center vertically, then I&#39;ll set these two icons to right and center vertically.
</text>
<text start="24158.47" dur="7.452">
So if they stay on their sides, if they move, the width gets there any changes in width
</text>
<text start="24165.922" dur="6.28">
there, I&#39;m going to also select the date picker row, and just specify that it&#39;s always stays
</text>
<text start="24172.202" dur="6.678">
on the bottom and is set to left and right so that it is constrained proportionately.
</text>
<text start="24178.88" dur="5.75">
And we should be good to go. So now with this calendar header created,
</text>
<text start="24184.63" dur="5.7">
we can go ahead and start to use this element across other mobile elements as well.
</text>
<text start="24190.33" dur="4.99">
So if I go ahead, and I can just duplicate this in case, I want to create a variant of
</text>
<text start="24195.32" dur="5.022">
it, but establish this as a main component and then duplicate that, we can go ahead and
</text>
<text start="24200.342" dur="6.61">
proceed to tackling our first date picker, which is the mobile input picker.
</text>
<text start="24206.952" dur="4.59">
So what we&#39;re going to do is we have the header, so we can copy the header.
</text>
<text start="24211.542" dur="5.66">
And we need a text input field here. So if I go to my assets and ensure that we
</text>
<text start="24217.202" dur="6.008">
always have our material design system library on, I&#39;m going to go ahead and search for text
</text>
<text start="24223.21" dur="4.39">input. And whoops text fields.</text>
<text start="24227.6" dur="5.98">Sorry. And then I can go ahead and just access a</text>
<text start="24233.58" dur="8.48">
text input field. And we can go ahead and select, say, this
</text>
<text start="24242.06" dur="5.562">
component. And what this component specified, we&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="24247.622" dur="4.858">
to want to wrap this in a frame as well. And just pay attention to the specs here.
</text>
<text start="24252.48" dur="4.562">
So the specs have the set to 16 dips on top from the top.
</text>
<text start="24257.042" dur="3.118">
And what we need to do is create a parent container.
</text>
<text start="24260.16" dur="8.41">
So we&#39;re going to establish this as the mobile mobile input picker.
</text>
<text start="24268.57" dur="4.792">
So this parent container will be called the mobile slash input picker, then I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="24273.362" dur="5.978">
to specify the height to 264. You&#39;ll see that there&#39;s some space there.
</text>
<text start="24279.34" dur="8.362">
And then I&#39;m going to go ahead and use this variation of the the component here.
</text>
<text start="24287.702" dur="12.07">
And just reference that. And place this into the container has the
</text>
<text start="24299.772" dur="5.43">
proper padding on the left and right already just need to ensure that the padding on the
</text>
<text start="24305.202" dur="7.648">
top set to 16 there, which it is. And now we just need to implement a background,
</text>
<text start="24312.85" dur="10.2">
which is set to Ville surfaces surface. And one thing to note is that we need to specify
</text>
<text start="24323.05" dur="4.68">
the corner radius of the parent container to for all around.
</text>
<text start="24327.73" dur="6.972">
And also, since this is a modal, here, in this scenario, we need to specify the elevation
</text>
<text start="24334.702" dur="10.09">
224 24 dip elevation on the parent container. And now we can go ahead and just use this
</text>
<text start="24344.792" dur="4.388">
example textfield. Notice that it isn&#39;t the right type of textfield.
</text>
<text start="24349.18" dur="7.18">
But this is just an example of the implementation. And here you&#39;ll notice that we might need
</text>
<text start="24356.36" dur="3.77">
another header variant. So that&#39;s kind of why I duplicated this here.
</text>
<text start="24360.13" dur="5.062">
So I want to actually maybe go ahead and delete this date picker row.
</text>
<text start="24365.192" dur="3.68">
And before I delete that date picker, I&#39;m gonna go ahead select the parent container
</text>
<text start="24368.872" dur="7.928">
and move this content up and make sure it snaps and then delete that day pick a row
</text>
<text start="24376.8" dur="2.572">
below and make that a main component and duplicate it.
</text>
<text start="24379.372" dur="6.99">
And then we&#39;ll use this one instead. So if I go ahead and delete that, can I paste
</text>
<text start="24386.362" dur="3.278">
this and snap it to the top, I can move this element up.
</text>
<text start="24389.64" dur="8.63">
So that is 16 picks dips from the top. We now have that date picker and the width
</text>
<text start="24398.27" dur="7.002">
is still set to is set to 364. So I need to change that to 264 and we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="24405.272" dur="3.538">
going to go ahead and implement some text only buttons now.
</text>
<text start="24408.81" dur="6.42">
So I&#39;m gonna go to my assets. Just pull in that text button and I need two
</text>
<text start="24415.23" dur="3.33">
of them. I need one that is says okay, so I&#39;m gonna
</text>
<text start="24418.56" dur="7.16">
go ahead and drag that in there. And we&#39;re going to want to do is snap that,
</text>
<text start="24425.72" dur="5.49">
in ensure that the typography aligns with the end of this text input field, which it
</text>
<text start="24431.21" dur="7.82">
does, meaning that this parent frame of the button is 16, dips to the right from the container,
</text>
<text start="24439.03" dur="4.28">
they&#39;re added to 16 dips from the bottom as well.
</text>
<text start="24443.31" dur="5.84">
So that is equivalent, equal size. And I&#39;m gonna type in cancel on this textfield.
</text>
<text start="24449.15" dur="5.302">
And once that&#39;s specified, we&#39;ll just align that here with this other button, and it has
</text>
<text start="24454.452" dur="6.32">
to be eight dips to the left of the OK button. So now, we have created our mobile input picker
</text>
<text start="24460.772" dur="4.148">
quickly. And this is one of the easier date pickers
</text>
<text start="24464.92" dur="3.16">
to implement. So with that, I&#39;m going to make this a main
</text>
<text start="24468.08" dur="4.001">
component, which is great. Now we got to, we got our first date picker
</text>
<text start="24472.081" dur="3.009">
here for mobile. And next, we&#39;re going to tackle one of the
</text>
<text start="24475.09" dur="4.3">
more complex components. So here, you&#39;ll start to see what these are
</text>
<text start="24479.39" dur="2.28">
composed on. Maybe we&#39;ll start with your selection view,
</text>
<text start="24481.67" dur="3.79">
it&#39;s a little simpler to tackle at first, not as overwhelming.
</text>
<text start="24485.46" dur="3">
But this is how we&#39;re going to break down this component.
</text>
<text start="24488.46" dur="5.6">
So what are we seeing here? Well, we&#39;re seeing that we need to create units, we can call
</text>
<text start="24494.06" dur="5.72">
these units or these cells, which will be our elements, Id elements for date pickers.
</text>
<text start="24499.78" dur="5.81">
And these elements contain the the text, of course, and it&#39;s giving us the dimensions
</text>
<text start="24505.59" dur="7.182">
of this, this cell that we&#39;re going to create, and it&#39;s 52 dips in height, and it is 88 dips
</text>
<text start="24512.772" dur="4.18">
wide. So we&#39;re gonna essentially, and it has a selected
</text>
<text start="24516.952" dur="2.75">
state variant. So we&#39;re going to need to make that selected
</text>
<text start="24519.702" dur="4.238">state as well. And that is Best Buy here.</text>
<text start="24523.94" dur="6.182">
72, dips wide and 36 dips in height, and it utilizes the primary background color.
</text>
<text start="24530.122" dur="4.868">
So that&#39;s great. And we already have our header component here.
</text>
<text start="24534.99" dur="4.462">So we can go ahead and bring a copy of that here.</text>
<text start="24539.452" dur="5.488">
And you&#39;ll notice that it doesn&#39;t utilize in the year selection view for the mobile
</text>
<text start="24544.94" dur="3.55">
input data input picker, doesn&#39;t utilize those icons there.
</text>
<text start="24548.49" dur="5.26">
So we can go ahead and just remove those. So when we delete those instances, in our
</text>
<text start="24553.75" dur="3.61">
instance, it&#39;ll just hide them, which is fine, don&#39;t worry about it.
</text>
<text start="24557.36" dur="5.2">
And we can go ahead and start to create these cells, right.
</text>
<text start="24562.56" dur="6.44">
So what we&#39;re going to go ahead and do is create a frame, label this elements space
</text>
<text start="24569" dur="12.1">
slash space, year selection, cell. And then we can label that the default cell,
</text>
<text start="24581.1" dur="7.37">
because we&#39;re going to have an active cell or selected cell to actually, we can label
</text>
<text start="24588.47" dur="4.41">
that this one unselected. And then we&#39;re going to create another one
</text>
<text start="24592.88" dur="5.31">
later called selected. So now we have both those ensure that the
</text>
<text start="24598.19" dur="6.49">
bill is set of surfaces surface, we&#39;re going to go and we&#39;re going to do is just specify
</text>
<text start="24604.68" dur="6.5">
the height for both of these 250 to kill two birds with one stone there.
</text>
<text start="24611.18" dur="5.04">And the width for both of them is set to 88 dips.</text>
<text start="24616.22" dur="3.822">
That&#39;s fantastic. Now we have typography in the middle.
</text>
<text start="24620.042" dur="11.098">
So on the cell, we have text, we can, let&#39;s see 2011, I can select that 2011.
</text>
<text start="24631.14" dur="5.61">
And I&#39;m going to make sure this typography set to high emphasis, and then ensure that
</text>
<text start="24636.75" dur="5.86">
the resizing set to auto width. And now I need to apply the proper text style.
</text>
<text start="24642.61" dur="8.85">
So it looks like it uses a caption. So it looks like it uses a caption, I&#39;m trying
</text>
<text start="24651.46" dur="7.89">
to just verify that their looks accurate. We can also reference the documentation if
</text>
<text start="24659.35" dur="8.63">
we ever get confused on what textiles being utilized some, but I have not found any specifications
</text>
<text start="24667.98" dur="5.82">on that. So here we have that typography.</text>
<text start="24673.8" dur="5.722">
For the text, maybe we want to apply. Let&#39;s double check and see if we need to utilize
</text>
<text start="24679.522" dur="4.438">the body text style. That looks much better.</text>
<text start="24683.96" dur="5.84">
So we apply that body textile just center it vertically and horizontally with the command,
</text>
<text start="24689.8" dur="3.62">
I mean, the shortcut keys, option V and H we should be good to go.
</text>
<text start="24693.42" dur="3.86">
So we have the cell. And now that we have that honestly, that was
</text>
<text start="24697.28" dur="4.2">
the only thing we were missing. We just need these the variant of this.
</text>
<text start="24701.48" dur="6.15">
So the variant of this, I&#39;m going to copy that text, paste it and with this cell, let&#39;s
</text>
<text start="24707.63" dur="3.22">
just set the constraints to center vertically and horizontally.
</text>
<text start="24710.85" dur="3.91">
And then do the same exact thing here within this container cell.
</text>
<text start="24714.76" dur="3.46">
So just stay center but there&#39;s not going to be a scenario where we need to resize them.
</text>
<text start="24718.22" dur="5">
Just for for best practices. So with the selected variant, we&#39;re gonna
</text>
<text start="24723.22" dur="5.51">
have to select the color content on primary, I know we can&#39;t see it, but we&#39;re gonna end
</text>
<text start="24728.73" dur="7.952">
up creating a rectangle with a width of 72 dips and a height of 36.
</text>
<text start="24736.682" dur="3.718">
And we&#39;re gonna have to round out the corners of this, we can change the corner radius to
</text>
<text start="24740.4" dur="3.85">
24. There, I&#39;m gonna center this, place this behind
</text>
<text start="24744.25" dur="6.792">
the typography, using command left bracket, so it changes in the layering order.
</text>
<text start="24751.042" dur="5.98">
And label that to state overlay. And now, we can go ahead and change the fill
</text>
<text start="24757.022" dur="5.008">
color to primary. And we have now achieved our selected state.
</text>
<text start="24762.03" dur="6.03">
And we should also specify that the typography, both the both of the alignments are set to
</text>
<text start="24768.06" dur="5.43">
text align center. So it resizes from from the middle, when your
</text>
<text start="24773.49" dur="3.282">
designers are renaming this. And we should be good to go.
</text>
<text start="24776.772" dur="4.548">
So now that we have both these cell variants, let&#39;s go ahead and just build out this year
</text>
<text start="24781.32" dur="2.91">
selection view. So here, you can start to see how we&#39;re building
</text>
<text start="24784.23" dur="4.62">
these modular elements to build out entire interfaces.
</text>
<text start="24788.85" dur="8.192">
So I&#39;m going to create these multiple components to have this one already.
</text>
<text start="24797.042" dur="5.548">
And we&#39;re going to want to go ahead and just move these up.
</text>
<text start="24802.59" dur="4.55">
And I&#39;m going to duplicate this on selected variant whoops.
</text>
<text start="24807.14" dur="8.21">
What&#39;s up duplicated that, what we want to specify is, let&#39;s say I&#39;m going to wrap this
</text>
<text start="24815.35" dur="6.49">
in a frame label this. I&#39;m going to grab the naming convention for
</text>
<text start="24821.84" dur="10.22">
this, the mobile This is the mobile year selection view, date picker variant.
</text>
<text start="24832.06" dur="6.62">
So this frame will be labeled exactly that. And I&#39;m going to apply a background color
</text>
<text start="24838.68" dur="6.78">
a fill color of surfaces surface. So now, I&#39;m just going to stretch that height
</text>
<text start="24845.46" dur="2.812">
out, because we haven&#39;t defined that exactly yet.
</text>
<text start="24848.272" dur="5.088">
But we will. And you&#39;ll notice that there&#39;s also a divider
</text>
<text start="24853.36" dur="4.97">
being used in this component, and then the content gets cut off under it.
</text>
<text start="24858.33" dur="7.39">
So we have three, five. So with this component selected, let&#39;s make
</text>
<text start="24865.72" dur="7.16">
sure it&#39;s within our, our frame here. So I&#39;m going to drag that in there, snap that
</text>
<text start="24872.88" dur="11.15">
to the left, make sure that is has a left padding of 24 and is snapping to the bottom
</text>
<text start="24884.03" dur="6.092">
of the calendar header. And what we can do is just go ahead and duplicate
</text>
<text start="24890.122" dur="2.768">
this. And there you know, there&#39;s a spacing of eight
</text>
<text start="24892.89" dur="5.68">
dips between the elements. And I just hit Command D to duplicate that.
</text>
<text start="24898.57" dur="4.262">
And now we can just shift select all three of these in this row.
</text>
<text start="24902.832" dur="6.938">
And I can go ahead and just duplicate those downward, hold down Command D, and they&#39;re
</text>
<text start="24909.77" dur="4.432">
all lined, as you can see here, there&#39;s no spacing between them vertically, only in terms
</text>
<text start="24914.202" dur="6.415">
of the width, there&#39;s that gutter, so for five, and then I got six, but I&#39;ll save six
</text>
<text start="24920.617" dur="5.005">
for later. And what we can do if there&#39;s way too many
</text>
<text start="24925.622" dur="5.348">
elements here, if that&#39;s, that&#39;s difficult for you to read, well, maybe we can just clean
</text>
<text start="24930.97" dur="6.96">
this up by selecting them in a row format. Or actually, we&#39;re going to want to group
</text>
<text start="24937.93" dur="6.28">
these in a column format, because on mobile, users will scroll through this, these columns
</text>
<text start="24944.21" dur="6.69">
vertically at imagine as opposed to horizontally. So you could create prototypes of this component
</text>
<text start="24950.9" dur="8.25">
in figma with this column layout, so I&#39;m gonna wrap this in a frame, label this column, column
</text>
<text start="24959.15" dur="7.472">
one, cell column one, if you want. Just maybe, maybe, maybe just label it column
</text>
<text start="24966.622" dur="4.368">
one, that might be easier. And then I&#39;ll do the same exact thing for
</text>
<text start="24970.99" dur="5.712">
this set of elements. Whoops, hold down Command Shift G to rename
</text>
<text start="24976.702" dur="7.798">
it and then rename it column two. Now we&#39;ll go ahead and tackle the third one.
</text>
<text start="24984.5" dur="7.842">
Very straightforward. Group it, rename it column three.
</text>
<text start="24992.342" dur="9.51">
And one thing about these columns is that there&#39;s there&#39;s five rows here, and in each
</text>
<text start="25001.852" dur="5.538">
column that are cut off, there&#39;s a sixth row that gets cut off, but we&#39;re going to save
</text>
<text start="25007.39" dur="5.732">
that and go ahead and implement our buttons once more.
</text>
<text start="25013.122" dur="2.92">
And we had already created the cancel and ok buttons here.
</text>
<text start="25016.042" dur="7.038">
So I&#39;m going to Command click On these, hold Shift return to select the parent layers and
</text>
<text start="25023.08" dur="3.852">copy that. And the padding set to 16 and 16.</text>
<text start="25026.932" dur="10.248">
Oh, each side, I&#39;m going to select the parent frame here and paste these and move them down
</text>
<text start="25037.18" dur="9.66">
and ensure that they&#39;re set to 24. And I believe, whoops, 24 on the right, and
</text>
<text start="25046.84" dur="7.09">
then 16 on the bottom, or eight on the bottom, I believe.
</text>
<text start="25053.93" dur="6.28">
Let&#39;s see, that looks correct. Looks like it does.
</text>
<text start="25060.21" dur="4.28">
And then we&#39;re going to ensure that we have a divider eight dips above.
</text>
<text start="25064.49" dur="5.47">
And we&#39;re going to go to our assets panel and just pull in that divider.
</text>
<text start="25069.96" dur="6.82">
and specify the width here, we want to make sure we have that width specified and make
</text>
<text start="25076.78" dur="4.012">
sure our parent container is for dip corner radius.
</text>
<text start="25080.792" dur="9.048">
So with this divider, need to change the width to 328 to span the full width of the the date
</text>
<text start="25089.84" dur="5.26">picker there. I&#39;m going to drag that in there.</text>
<text start="25095.1" dur="5.442">
push that up. So it&#39;s eight dips from the buttons.
</text>
<text start="25100.542" dur="6.438">
And now all we&#39;re going to do is select our columns, hold down Command and drag it to
</text>
<text start="25106.98" dur="6.1">
the to snap to our divider. And select clip content.
</text>
<text start="25113.08" dur="7.5">
And what we&#39;re gonna do in each row is I&#39;m gonna hold column, Command D, and then drag
</text>
<text start="25120.58" dur="7.97">
this so it snaps. So you can see that one, when this content
</text>
<text start="25128.55" dur="9.63">
gets pushed down, it whoops, the content gets pushed down, it is ignored.
</text>
<text start="25138.18" dur="6.43">
So that&#39;s important. But you can&#39;t actually see it in the way we&#39;ve
</text>
<text start="25144.61" dur="5.252">
currently implemented it. One thing we do need to add is a selected
</text>
<text start="25149.862" dur="6.078">
state, for example. So I could go ahead and delete this, copy
</text>
<text start="25155.94" dur="7.912">
this instance, select that column and whoops, select the second column or any column and
</text>
<text start="25163.852" dur="3.93">
paste it in there. And just make sure it&#39;s aligned appropriately.
</text>
<text start="25167.782" dur="11.948">
And we know how that your selection view implemented. And we now have our our date picker views
</text>
<text start="25179.73" dur="6.69">
or your selection view of them look, just copy these once more.
</text>
<text start="25186.42" dur="5.541">
So here we have that column. But you can&#39;t actually see it, and how we
</text>
<text start="25191.961" dur="8.69">
specified it currently. But you get the idea of this component, although
</text>
<text start="25200.651" dur="9.359">
it appears to be hidden. So we can do the same exact thing here is
</text>
<text start="25210.01" dur="11.07">
duplicating this. Making sure that are snapping appropriately.
</text>
<text start="25221.08" dur="5.45">
And now I have these column views built out and we&#39;re good to go we have our year selection
</text>
<text start="25226.53" dur="3.592">view. So if I ever wanted to actually swap this</text>
<text start="25230.122" dur="3.898">
component with a selected one, due to our naming conventions, we can go ahead and do
</text>
<text start="25234.02" dur="4.87">
that very, very quickly in our instance, drop down menu.
</text>
<text start="25238.89" dur="4.3">
And that is our year selection view. Make that a main component.
</text>
<text start="25243.19" dur="6.16">
Go ahead and drag that over there. And now that that one specified we have to
</text>
<text start="25249.35" dur="4.692">
created. Let&#39;s go ahead and tackle one of the more
</text>
<text start="25254.042" dur="7.818">complex views. So with this calendar view.</text>
<text start="25261.86" dur="6.79">
Let&#39;s go ahead and copy that naming convention. Here on mobile, we have the calendar view,
</text>
<text start="25268.65" dur="9.972">
we clearly can utilize the mobile header calendar header.
</text>
<text start="25278.622" dur="2.618">
So we have that. So our mobile calendar adders done, we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="25281.24" dur="5.122">
going to wrap it in a frame, it&#39;s going to be called mobile slash calendar view.
</text>
<text start="25286.362" dur="3.738">And we are going to specify the height to be 512.</text>
<text start="25290.1" dur="5.37">
Whoops. And once that&#39;s set to 512, we&#39;re going to
</text>
<text start="25295.47" dur="7.87">
set the fill color to surfaces surface. And again, this year selection view actually
</text>
<text start="25303.34" dur="7.702">
has I apologize, in effect style 24 dips, and so does this calendar view so let&#39;s go
</text>
<text start="25311.042" dur="8.74">
ahead and specify that and in this element need to go ahead and change this 000 color
</text>
<text start="25319.782" dur="6.598">
style to texting iconography high emphasis. Now that everything is attached color styles
</text>
<text start="25326.38" dur="2.452">
are good to go. And on this calendar, you&#39;ll specify the corner
</text>
<text start="25328.832" dur="4.628">
radius to four dips. So now that we have that, we need to start
</text>
<text start="25333.46" dur="5.39">
creating these individual cells. So in this format, we&#39;re going to go ahead
</text>
<text start="25338.85" dur="13.98">
and specify the date here. So it is utilizing a cell of 40 by 40 dips.
</text>
<text start="25352.83" dur="8.38">
So make that frame 40 by 40, set the fill to surfaces surface and copy this textile
</text>
<text start="25361.21" dur="10.632">
not so paste it in here, and center it and just the only difference being the color.
</text>
<text start="25371.842" dur="6.488">
So this uses a medium emphasis, color style. So we need to specify that set that medium
</text>
<text start="25378.33" dur="7.192">
emphasis, I can even duplicate this, whoops, can duplicate it, I&#39;m sure that that&#39;s set
</text>
<text start="25385.522" dur="4.258">to a number now. And that is centered.</text>
<text start="25389.78" dur="7.33">
And the numbers have a color style high emphasis. We&#39;re going to need to name these cells.
</text>
<text start="25397.11" dur="15.78">
So we have we have the it&#39;s an element. And this is the date, cell day SEL.
</text>
<text start="25412.89" dur="5.95">
de sel. And then we&#39;re going to go ahead and copy
</text>
<text start="25418.84" dur="17.54">
that specify this as as the elements date. Day, so right now date, number.
</text>
<text start="25436.38" dur="6.992">
So you can name it honestly, whatever makes most sense for you or your team or organization.
</text>
<text start="25443.372" dur="8.338">
And then of course, we&#39;re going to need a Ace unselected variant, which is what this
</text>
<text start="25451.71" dur="4.742">
will be. And then we&#39;ll have a selected variant as
</text>
<text start="25456.452" dur="4.84">well. If I go ahead and change that to selected.</text>
<text start="25461.292" dur="6.768">
And with the selected variant, we need a rectangle set 36 by 36 dips.
</text>
<text start="25468.06" dur="6.32">
With the primary colors when you change this color style to content on primary, then go
</text>
<text start="25474.38" dur="7.632">
ahead and create a rectangle within the frame. set that to 36 or 36 dips and round, round
</text>
<text start="25482.012" dur="4.898">
it out and then center it and use Command left bracket to push it backwards.
</text>
<text start="25486.91" dur="5.032">
And our now that we have this selected state, we need to change the fill color to primary.
</text>
<text start="25491.942" dur="12.33">
And we now have our text style set properly. So we may want to push this over one pixel
</text>
<text start="25504.272" dur="5.648">
as it doesn&#39;t look centered optically. But now it does since we push it over.
</text>
<text start="25509.92" dur="4.42">
And with that we can go ahead and make this a main component.
</text>
<text start="25514.34" dur="5.47">
And everything should be scaling accordingly. I&#39;ll set the constraints properly to the selected
</text>
<text start="25519.81" dur="3.45">
state as well. And this typography is good to go make that
</text>
<text start="25523.26" dur="8.628">
a main component and make the date day a main component and the date numbers element component.
</text>
<text start="25531.888" dur="4.102">
And we should be good to go. All we need to do is start to compose this
</text>
<text start="25535.99" dur="8.64">
accordingly. So in this variant, you can see that the dates
</text>
<text start="25544.63" dur="9.33">
are displayed and they snap it looks like right below the right below the calendar header.
</text>
<text start="25553.96" dur="6.082">
So I&#39;m going to make that snap and the padding left is set to 24.
</text>
<text start="25560.042" dur="8.628">
And all I&#39;m going to do is duplicate this and make sure it&#39;s for four dips to the to
</text>
<text start="25568.67" dur="3.19">
the right. And then I&#39;m going to duplicate it again and
</text>
<text start="25571.86" dur="4.44">
keep duplicating it. And since I have that spacing specified, I
</text>
<text start="25576.3" dur="10.34">
am good to go see a duplicate. Now that I have those three, six, I need to
</text>
<text start="25586.64" dur="10.222">
apply this seven days here in the week. And I now have that I&#39;m gonna go ahead and
</text>
<text start="25596.862" dur="4.298">
double check my spacing here. So the spacing is not supposed to be set 24
</text>
<text start="25601.16" dur="5.962">
on the left, it&#39;s supposed to be set to 12 for for the cells and that actually selecting
</text>
<text start="25607.122" dur="3.738">the date and I have it set to 24. So my apologies.</text>
<text start="25610.86" dur="7.6">
For now now the content is centered properly and now we&#39;re going to do is go ahead Select
</text>
<text start="25618.46" dur="6.98">
our date number cell and duplicate that and snap that here.
</text>
<text start="25625.44" dur="3.572">
So that&#39;s day one. And then we&#39;re going to go ahead and create
</text>
<text start="25629.012" dur="7.418">
an entire row of this. And it&#39;s going to be very simple, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="25636.43" dur="5.21">
to go ahead and create one row with you. So all we have to do is duplicate it, ensure
</text>
<text start="25641.64" dur="3.85">
that there&#39;s four pixel spacing between all elements here.
</text>
<text start="25645.49" dur="6.622">
And I&#39;m going to just keep repeating that all the way across the entire row.
</text>
<text start="25652.112" dur="8.48">
And I&#39;m gonna just do the same thing, select all these elements, and ensure that they all
</text>
<text start="25660.592" dur="4.288">stack. And just duplicate that again and duplicate</text>
<text start="25664.88" dur="5.302">
it again, and I have my, my 556 rows in its entirety.
</text>
<text start="25670.182" dur="7.848">
And we just need one more, we need the bottom one, which is day 32.
</text>
<text start="25678.03" dur="5.12">
Go ahead and check that out. And what we can do, since we have our components
</text>
<text start="25683.15" dur="4.282">
named properly, I can click this and make sure it&#39;s the selected state.
</text>
<text start="25687.432" dur="7.208">
And I&#39;m going to pause this video and go ahead and add in these buttons and also rename all
</text>
<text start="25694.64" dur="3.07">these days. So I&#39;ll be right back.</text>
<text start="25697.71" dur="6.7">
Now I&#39;ve created this mobile calendar view. And all I did was I copied the buttons from
</text>
<text start="25704.41" dur="6.56">
our year selection view, because the spacing specifications are the same on this calendar
</text>
<text start="25710.97" dur="3.152">view. So I pasted that in by and I pasted it once</text>
<text start="25714.122" dur="6.548">
I selected the parent container. And that did me a big favor and just applied
</text>
<text start="25720.67" dur="4.26">
that exact same position. And here you go, we have our calendar view,
</text>
<text start="25724.93" dur="9.342">
mature the new main component now. And we&#39;ve we&#39;ve kind of debunked the complexity
</text>
<text start="25734.272" dur="4.858">
of this and the only thing missing is this current date.
</text>
<text start="25739.13" dur="4.21">
So that is the current date cell. So we&#39;re going to do is duplicate the date
</text>
<text start="25743.34" dur="4.62">
number cell that&#39;s selected, and then we&#39;re going to detach that, and I&#39;m going to go
</text>
<text start="25747.96" dur="6.582">
ahead and rename this to current date as it&#39;s a specific cell.
</text>
<text start="25754.542" dur="5.33">
And then, with the current date specified, I&#39;m going to select my rectangle and apply
</text>
<text start="25759.872" dur="8.428">
a one pixel stroke. That is, should be set to let&#39;s see surfaces
</text>
<text start="25768.3" dur="3.18">
high emphasis, and we&#39;re going to delete that fill.
</text>
<text start="25771.48" dur="8.63">
And we&#39;re gonna go ahead and select our text now and ensure that the content is set to
</text>
<text start="25780.11" dur="5.65">
active or high emphasis. So that is our current date variant of the
</text>
<text start="25785.76" dur="2.67">
cell. So what I can do is make this a master component
</text>
<text start="25788.43" dur="4.95">
or main components use me. And then we can even go ahead and select this
</text>
<text start="25793.38" dur="5.13">
cell in our calendar view now. And now we have a current date variant.
</text>
<text start="25798.51" dur="2.772">
So now we have that. And with our current date variant, I&#39;m going
</text>
<text start="25801.282" dur="5.09">
to actually push that pixel one pixel over to the right, whoops, one pixel over to the
</text>
<text start="25806.372" dur="8.348">
left, make it look more optically aligned. And we&#39;re now good to go.
</text>
<text start="25814.72" dur="5.27">
And now we can go ahead and set this aside in the calendar view.
</text>
<text start="25819.99" dur="8.452">
We have our the proper cells needed for our our calendars for mobile.
</text>
<text start="25828.442" dur="9.388">
And we also have a mobile range picker, which I&#39;m going to set aside and let you challenge
</text>
<text start="25837.83" dur="3.73">
yourself and build that. And essentially, with this overlay, what you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="25841.56" dur="9.792">
gonna want to do is just create an element that you can overlay or place under all of
</text>
<text start="25851.352" dur="8.51">
these rows here, these are the cells to view that effect accordingly.
</text>
<text start="25859.862" dur="6.938">
So what we can do in actually our, our calendar component is go ahead and start to select
</text>
<text start="25866.8" dur="3.76">
all of these. And you could put them in columns or rows
</text>
<text start="25870.56" dur="3.642">
as needed. So for example, whatever you and your team
</text>
<text start="25874.202" dur="4.34">
find most efficient, I can specify this as row three.
</text>
<text start="25878.542" dur="8.888">
Here, you can clearly see that we have row row one.
</text>
<text start="25887.43" dur="5.67">So row one, and then this happens to be row two.</text>
<text start="25893.1" dur="3.04">
So that&#39;s important. And I just realized I messed up this calendar
</text>
<text start="25896.14" dur="3.732">
view, we need this calendar view to stack properly.
</text>
<text start="25899.872" dur="6.31">
So if I go ahead and click on this calendar view, it&#39;s actually not positioned properly.
</text>
<text start="25906.182" dur="5.918">
So I need to go ahead and what I&#39;m going to do is pause this and make all of these rows
</text>
<text start="25912.1" dur="6.23">
and I&#39;ll and make sure I push this element down and I&#39;ll be right back on my element
</text>
<text start="25918.33" dur="5.03">
align properly and I grouped them into rows. Even if there&#39;s only one element on that row,
</text>
<text start="25923.36" dur="4.332">
say you were to build out that entire row moving forward, you could stretch this out
</text>
<text start="25927.692" dur="5.15">
and snap it, you can ensure that the width snapped appropriately.
</text>
<text start="25932.842" dur="4.658">
And then if you needed to modify it, you can go ahead and duplicate insert snapping elements
</text>
<text start="25937.5" dur="4.21">
to the, to the end and middle of your elements as needed.
</text>
<text start="25941.71" dur="7">
It&#39;s just a quick way to keep things organized. And just also just keep those layers clean,
</text>
<text start="25948.71" dur="6.06">
it&#39;s highly recommended, as you can see here, and those wrapped into frames.
</text>
<text start="25954.77" dur="6.91">
If not, it&#39;s a ton of cells just being viewed when you expand it in the Layers panel.
</text>
<text start="25961.68" dur="4.42">
So that&#39;s why we have our counter view done. And I&#39;m going to challenge you to build out
</text>
<text start="25966.1" dur="8.06">
the this other view, the mobile range picker will have a selected state.
</text>
<text start="25974.16" dur="3.86">
And for the selected state, you&#39;ll have the two months as well.
</text>
<text start="25978.02" dur="6.69">
So you can detach the calendar editor and copy those the tax property and whatnot.
</text>
<text start="25984.71" dur="7.93">
In Yeah, you just need to create like a selected state element, turned that into component,
</text>
<text start="25992.64" dur="6.42">
and then just put that under the rows. And you can reference the calendar view for
</text>
<text start="25999.06" dur="2.71">
that. So now we&#39;re going to go ahead and approach
</text>
<text start="26001.77" dur="5.682">
a variant of the desktop. Desktop is slightly different.
</text>
<text start="26007.452" dur="4.898">
Since it&#39;s on a bigger device, you&#39;ll notice that it&#39;s very dense.
</text>
<text start="26012.35" dur="5.48">
on the desktop, here, we have a very dense view, where the cells for the desktop variant
</text>
<text start="26017.83" dur="6.042">
are set to 32 by 32 dips here. Same same states for each cell, we have the
</text>
<text start="26023.872" dur="6.978">
current date, we have the selected date, and then we have the default one here.
</text>
<text start="26030.85" dur="9.48">
And yeah, I mean, we&#39;re gonna and then we also have one of the more complex ones, the
</text>
<text start="26040.33" dur="6.49">
date range picker, where it&#39;s the where you&#39;re selecting from one month to another month.
</text>
<text start="26046.82" dur="6.18">
And we&#39;re going to go ahead and build out this date range picker.
</text>
<text start="26053" dur="4.502">
And then I&#39;m going to challenge you to build out the the following date range pickers by
</text>
<text start="26057.502" dur="6.1">
yourself as this is a very dense video of information that shouldn&#39;t be good practice
</text>
<text start="26063.602" dur="3.158">
for you. So we&#39;re going to go ahead and start off by
</text>
<text start="26066.76" dur="10.46">
identifying the low level elements. So with that said, we, we have here, cells
</text>
<text start="26077.22" dur="4.09">set to 32 by 32. And then we have these icons.</text>
<text start="26081.31" dur="5.21">
So I&#39;m going to go ahead and grab these cells here.
</text>
<text start="26086.52" dur="6.432">
Since we have, since we did apply constraints to these cells, all we have to do is detach
</text>
<text start="26092.952" dur="7.508">
them, renamed them properly. And now that I realize it, we&#39;re going to
</text>
<text start="26100.46" dur="5.94">
need to categorize these cells. So these are going to be the mobile versions.
</text>
<text start="26106.4" dur="4.82">
So we&#39;re gonna have to categorize all of these to live under under mobile, because we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="26111.22" dur="9.572">
going to have cells for desktop as well. So I&#39;m just going in, and just renaming certain
</text>
<text start="26120.792" dur="6">elements here. Just applying mobile.</text>
<text start="26126.792" dur="7.188">So just going in copying and pasting real quick.</text>
<text start="26133.98" dur="5.46">
And once you&#39;ve done that, you should be good to go.
</text>
<text start="26139.44" dur="6.03">
And now the nice thing about this is, since we renamed all these to mobile, we can go
</text>
<text start="26145.47" dur="6.13">
ahead and copy all these variants, we may not need these at first, but I&#39;m going to
</text>
<text start="26151.6" dur="4.54">
detach those instances. And we can go ahead and change if we batch
</text>
<text start="26156.14" dur="6.99">
renamed by select everything, and then hit command R, and then I type in mobile, I can
</text>
<text start="26163.13" dur="5.242">
then go down to this replace with and type in desktop.
</text>
<text start="26168.372" dur="4.938">
So now I have my desktop variants. If we look into the layers here, we have our
</text>
<text start="26173.31" dur="4.34">
desktop cells. And since our constraints are set properly
</text>
<text start="26177.65" dur="8.66">
to center, we can just modify the parent container and everything will resize properly so that
</text>
<text start="26186.31" dur="3.85">
that&#39;s very helpful. One thing we are going to want to do is create
</text>
<text start="26190.16" dur="9.15">
this selected state here, this selected this this range here of the between the the current
</text>
<text start="26199.31" dur="3.93">
date, the selected date, the start date, and the end date.
</text>
<text start="26203.24" dur="5.022">
So we&#39;re going to want to do is create that right now.
</text>
<text start="26208.262" dur="8.578">
So we need to ensure that we know what the height of this day is set to so we it might
</text>
<text start="26216.84" dur="11.11">
be referenced In another spec, that selected date there, let&#39;s see.
</text>
<text start="26227.95" dur="8.68">
on desktop the height of that, more than likely set to 28.
</text>
<text start="26236.63" dur="6.85">
dips in height, slow my go with. Yep, yep, set to 28.
</text>
<text start="26243.48" dur="5.11">
Now with that said, let&#39;s go ahead and just start cranking this out, I&#39;m going to grab
</text>
<text start="26248.59" dur="11.9">
the icons, I need here, my, my arrows here, left and right, I&#39;m gonna need my copy this
</text>
<text start="26260.49" dur="5.71">year. We don&#39;t need no drop down arrow.</text>
<text start="26266.2" dur="6.58">
So I&#39;m gonna delete that. I do need this caption textile.
</text>
<text start="26272.78" dur="4.85">
Sure that set too high emphasis. Go change that here, make sure that&#39;s set
</text>
<text start="26277.63" dur="4.912">
to high emphasis. Know that that&#39;s systematize, we can go ahead
</text>
<text start="26282.542" dur="10.308">
and move on, we have a frame here. And let&#39;s go ahead and grab this name here,
</text>
<text start="26292.85" dur="4.61">
desktop date range picker. So now that I&#39;ve copied that, select this
</text>
<text start="26297.46" dur="4.69">
parent name, parent frame. And we&#39;ll go ahead and set the corner radius
</text>
<text start="26302.15" dur="8.17">
to four. And we got a height of width of 512 dips and
</text>
<text start="26310.32" dur="9.29">
a height of 280. And with that, we can get rolling.
</text>
<text start="26319.61" dur="6.6">
So one thing we can do is focus on the base layer of the of these components.
</text>
<text start="26326.21" dur="6.701">
Right? So what is the base layer? Well, things that aren&#39;t going to be moving that will stay
</text>
<text start="26332.911" dur="6.739">
in place is and that will be as dynamic dependent upon the month since are specific days and
</text>
<text start="26339.65" dur="3.01">each month. So this will all change these cells.</text>
<text start="26342.66" dur="6.75">
So that&#39;ll vary in like the how many rows they&#39;ll be, there&#39;ll be and how many cells
</text>
<text start="26349.41" dur="5.182">in each row. But the days will stay.</text>
<text start="26354.592" dur="3.53">And the arrow and month will stay in this divider.</text>
<text start="26358.122" dur="5.318">
So we&#39;re gonna go ahead and add this divider, this divider takes up the whole height of
</text>
<text start="26363.44" dur="6.77">
this, this date range picker. So if we go to our assets panel, option to
</text>
<text start="26370.21" dur="7.73">
pull in that divider, I&#39;m going to hit Command Shift Option type in rotate left, and then
</text>
<text start="26377.94" dur="6.47">
I&#39;m going to now I have it vertically set. And it&#39;s already in my parent frame in the
</text>
<text start="26384.41" dur="3.762">
parent container, which is great, I&#39;m gonna set the height to 280.
</text>
<text start="26388.172" dur="5.568">
So then I&#39;m gonna just hold down Option v option h.
</text>
<text start="26393.74" dur="6.33">
So now it is horizontally aligned perfect. Li in between both sides have this date range
</text>
<text start="26400.07" dur="4.102">
picker, as indicated here. And if we haven&#39;t already, let&#39;s go ahead
</text>
<text start="26404.172" dur="9.008">
and change this fill to surfaces surface. Apply lips, plan effect style of eight dips,
</text>
<text start="26413.18" dur="6.29">
because this is used in menus and sub menus, like a menu or sub menu.
</text>
<text start="26419.47" dur="4.67">
And now we&#39;re gonna go ahead and add in our, our arrows.
</text>
<text start="26424.14" dur="8.11">
So with that said, we&#39;re going to add this arrow here, add the second arrow there.
</text>
<text start="26432.25" dur="11.33">
And it is 16 dips from the top and right. So if I snap that, whoops 16 dips from the
</text>
<text start="26443.58" dur="6.692">
top and right, we&#39;re good to go there. And with that applied now we need to go and
</text>
<text start="26450.272" dur="9.508">
copy this textile. And September here seems to be a 32 dips from
</text>
<text start="26459.78" dur="3.36">
the baseline through two digits from the top of the parent container.
</text>
<text start="26463.14" dur="9.482">
And the spacing seems to be aligned. Center horizontally between these elements
</text>
<text start="26472.622" dur="7.988">
specified here. So if we do 256 minus 32, we get 224.
</text>
<text start="26480.61" dur="6.9">So if we create a frame of, of 224 digits wide.</text>
<text start="26487.51" dur="13.032">
So if I wrap this in a frame, label this as row one or header row header, I just label
</text>
<text start="26500.542" dur="5.3">
that header. When I specify this to 224, you&#39;ll notice
</text>
<text start="26505.842" dur="3.66">
that that distance gives me 16 digits to the right.
</text>
<text start="26509.502" dur="5.87">
And why I&#39;m wrapping this in a frame is because when I copy this text here, and I paste it
</text>
<text start="26515.372" dur="5.698">
in this header, so I&#39;m gonna paste it in there. And it&#39;s in that parent frame.
</text>
<text start="26521.07" dur="6.612">
So I&#39;m going to vertically align and horizontally align it so that it is vertical here on the
</text>
<text start="26527.682" dur="4.318">
calendar side. And one thing I could even do is, if I wanted,
</text>
<text start="26532" dur="5.46">
I, if I don&#39;t want to repeat that, I can delete this icon.
</text>
<text start="26537.46" dur="7.23">
And what I can do is select the icon here, and Hold OPTION D and snap that to the right
</text>
<text start="26544.69" dur="9.61">
and then hit Shift H and that aligns properly. And now I have this spacing set appropriately.
</text>
<text start="26554.3" dur="4.322">
So that&#39;s awesome. So now we have September and October.
</text>
<text start="26558.622" dur="5.588">
So I can rename that. And one thing we want to ensure is that it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="26564.21" dur="7.3">
set to text align center on both elements. And we&#39;re gonna go ahead and specify that
</text>
<text start="26571.51" dur="8.84">
the this typography centers horizontally in terms of when it resizes.
</text>
<text start="26580.35" dur="4.88">
So that&#39;s important. So go ahead, change that to October 2019,
</text>
<text start="26585.23" dur="12.12">
then we&#39;ll change this to sep tember 2019. And we should be good to go.
</text>
<text start="26597.35" dur="6.522">
Awesome. So with that specify, we have the header left.
</text>
<text start="26603.872" dur="10.878">
And then we have the header, right. And these could both be categorized on the
</text>
<text start="26614.75" dur="6.83">
left, like month, left and month, right. So we&#39;re going to start off with these days
</text>
<text start="26621.58" dur="5.292">
here for the desktop view. And again, there, they have a height of 32
</text>
<text start="26626.872" dur="2.428">
by 32 dips, which we&#39;ve already specified here.
</text>
<text start="26629.3" dur="5.572">
And what we want to do is I&#39;m going to select all these cells here.
</text>
<text start="26634.872" dur="7.15">
And now I want to actually go ahead and resize these to 32.
</text>
<text start="26642.022" dur="3.688">
And notice that all the content centered and then it got cropped, right.
</text>
<text start="26645.71" dur="4.72">
But the reason this has been cropped is because we need to specify this to have a height and
</text>
<text start="26650.43" dur="2.73">
width of 28. And then I&#39;m gonna go ahead and center that
</text>
<text start="26653.16" dur="3.18">
once more. And I&#39;m gonna do the same exact thing for
</text>
<text start="26656.34" dur="7.032">
the current date cell type. So now and then just center that now we are
</text>
<text start="26663.372" dur="3.482">
good to go. We have pushed us over one pixel so that it
</text>
<text start="26666.854" dur="11.428">
is center and our elements here. With that center, we are good to go.
</text>
<text start="26678.282" dur="5.388">
So now I&#39;m going to create these multiple main components.
</text>
<text start="26683.67" dur="7.352">
And I can copy this desktop Daiso is what it&#39;s currently labeled as.
</text>
<text start="26691.022" dur="2.948">
And I&#39;m going to specify the date on both the left and right sides.
</text>
<text start="26693.97" dur="10.152">
And as you can see here, the spacing here between the icon above and between the dates
</text>
<text start="26704.122" dur="2.91">
isn&#39;t specified might be specified here, it&#39;s set to 12.
</text>
<text start="26707.032" dur="7.84">
As you can see, set to 12. So we can go ahead and implement that here,
</text>
<text start="26714.872" dur="6.528">
select that date range picker, paste it, no option, a snap that in 60 set to 16 dips in
</text>
<text start="26721.4" dur="5.33">
the left and the spacings 12 already by default. So this is awesome, I can go ahead and just
</text>
<text start="26726.73" dur="6.1">
copy these dates. And now I have all seven days here specified.
</text>
<text start="26732.83" dur="7.09">
And what I can do is select all these from the get go my Layers panel, group them, label
</text>
<text start="26739.92" dur="5.852">them. Row days, I can label this as row days or</text>
<text start="26745.772" dur="6.538">
whatever you find most intuitive or most effective. That&#39;s what I recommend.
</text>
<text start="26752.31" dur="6.89">
And then I&#39;m going to ensure it Whoa, that the spacing here is set appropriately.
</text>
<text start="26759.2" dur="3.97">And once that is set properly, we are good to go.</text>
<text start="26763.17" dur="9.44">
Have those days here. Road days, left, push that up.
</text>
<text start="26772.61" dur="4.932">
Whoops. And then I&#39;m gonna organize these in my Layers
</text>
<text start="26777.542" dur="4.198">
panel accordingly, the header right and then the road days, right.
</text>
<text start="26781.74" dur="11.32">
And then next, we&#39;re going to want to just go ahead and start implementing our our days
</text>
<text start="26793.06" dur="5.32">
here. And what I&#39;m going to do is just copy this
</text>
<text start="26798.38" dur="10.04">
date number so for the desktop, paste it and with that, we have it now a line already.
</text>
<text start="26808.42" dur="6.53">
And then we&#39;re going to just create these rows here and there is no spacing between
</text>
<text start="26814.95" dur="3.83">
these cells. So I can just keep going Hitting Command D
</text>
<text start="26818.78" dur="10.93">
to replicate that. Then I can group this, label this row three,
</text>
<text start="26829.71" dur="9.04">
row three left, then I can label this, whoops, I can group this as well, road to left.
</text>
<text start="26838.75" dur="7.532">
And then what I can do is just continue to duplicate this downward, and just ensure that
</text>
<text start="26846.282" dur="8.718">
these are incrementing properly. So this is row four.
</text>
<text start="26855" dur="7.91">
And then we got row five here in action, and then we got, we got row six.
</text>
<text start="26862.91" dur="3.3">
So we&#39;re gonna go ahead and verify how many rows are needed here.
</text>
<text start="26866.21" dur="8.09">
For this day, we got, we got five, six, in total, we got 1234, we need to create one
</text>
<text start="26874.3" dur="11.36">
more row seems like she doesn&#39;t seem right, whoops, I&#39;m checking out the wrong 1234566
</text>
<text start="26885.66" dur="5.712">in total. So we have 123456.</text>
<text start="26891.372" dur="18.67">
And this row, we only got, oh, we only have one here specified one day on the last row,
</text>
<text start="26910.042" dur="5.178">
and there&#39;s a eight dip, eight pixel padding there on the bottom.
</text>
<text start="26915.22" dur="6.03">
So I need to go ahead and verify that currently, it&#39;s set to four, I don&#39;t know why that is.
</text>
<text start="26921.25" dur="7.21">
And then the padding on top set to 16. And the bottom is set to eight.
</text>
<text start="26928.46" dur="9.642">
And then I have the height set to 280. But it&#39;s still prompting me with dimensions
</text>
<text start="26938.102" dur="7.85">
of four on the bottom, which I don&#39;t understand. So what we can do is go ahead and select our
</text>
<text start="26945.952" dur="8.25">
parent frame and just specify that to eight. currently set to seven.
</text>
<text start="26954.202" dur="6.258">
So I&#39;ll just push that down one more pixel. And there we have it, we now have that this
</text>
<text start="26960.46" dur="5.92">
variant here made, I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to go ahead and pause this and make this other
</text>
<text start="26966.38" dur="5.492">
side and you should do the same. And I&#39;m just going to name everything accordingly.
</text>
<text start="26971.872" dur="3.75">
positive. So now I&#39;ve created these rows here on the
</text>
<text start="26975.622" dur="3.66">
right side. So I&#39;m going to just allow you to go ahead
</text>
<text start="26979.282" dur="3.638">
and add all the dates and days here so that it&#39;s precise.
</text>
<text start="26982.92" dur="3.92">
And you can align it with what is specified in the spec here.
</text>
<text start="26986.84" dur="4.98">
And I&#39;m going to challenge you to make this date desktop date picker by yourself.
</text>
<text start="26991.82" dur="6.34">
And the year selection view, we already have the elements here ready and named properly
</text>
<text start="26998.16" dur="4.792">
for design system. And you just need to resize these a year selection
</text>
<text start="27002.952" dur="3.608">
cells. And one thing you can I&#39;m going to go over
</text>
<text start="27006.56" dur="7.7">
with you but not build out in pilot I&#39;m going to just guide you is creating this date range
</text>
<text start="27014.26" dur="5.112">
selection. So what you&#39;re going to want to do to represent
</text>
<text start="27019.372" dur="10.538">
that range selection, we&#39;re going to I duplicated this and just removed the the fill and change
</text>
<text start="27029.91" dur="4.99">
this color here on the shape to primary low emphasis.
</text>
<text start="27034.9" dur="5.05">
And I changed the constraints so that the constraints of this were on this element,
</text>
<text start="27039.95" dur="4.51">
I need to detach it My bad. Now I need to select the shape and set the
</text>
<text start="27044.46" dur="3.27">
constraints to left and right. So that way, when I select the parent container,
</text>
<text start="27047.73" dur="5.16">
I can stretch it out properly. So I can I can get that range I need.
</text>
<text start="27052.89" dur="5.04">
And under range, I&#39;m going to select deaths, it&#39;s going to be named elements slash desktop
</text>
<text start="27057.93" dur="9.46">
slash range selection. So that&#39;s that now that we have that you can
</text>
<text start="27067.39" dur="4.88">
go ahead and you know, make that a main component, and you can copy it.
</text>
<text start="27072.27" dur="4.69">
And then how you would use it is if you paste it into your date range picker, you&#39;re going
</text>
<text start="27076.96" dur="7.31">
to want to place it behind all your layers below and align it with the height and the
</text>
<text start="27084.27" dur="3.21">
size of the your text box. And then you can go ahead and start stretching
</text>
<text start="27087.48" dur="11.98">
that out as needed to select your dates. And do note that everything&#39;s good to go in
</text>
<text start="27099.46" dur="5.51">
that regard. And there is a state where it&#39;s just one cell
</text>
<text start="27104.97" dur="4.86">
to so that&#39;s awesome. And that is all I have to show you today.
</text>
<text start="27109.83" dur="4.51">
Folks, I challenge you to make this, these other desktop variants and this mobile variant
</text>
<text start="27114.34" dur="3.9">
and with all that knowledge you should you have all the cells and everything needed.
</text>
<text start="27118.24" dur="4.16">
In to build the following. And thank you so much for watching.
</text>
<text start="27122.4" dur="6.03">
And this was a long one, hope you learned a lot, and how to deconstruct these images
</text>
<text start="27128.43" dur="5.09">
and actually turn this into a system. I know, it&#39;s challenging, but very rewarding
</text>
<text start="27133.52" dur="3.332">
for you. If you can get this into your muscle memory,
</text>
<text start="27136.852" dur="6.19">
as a designer, you will become a very valuable design system designer and designer.
</text>
<text start="27143.042" dur="6.268">
Today, we&#39;re going to be building out some dividers very straightforward.
</text>
<text start="27149.31" dur="4.24">
And we&#39;re going to cover how they&#39;re used, and then just create them, it&#39;ll be super
</text>
<text start="27153.55" dur="3.652">
quick and easy. The longest part will be just describing the
</text>
<text start="27157.202" dur="2.678">
usage. So a divider is a thin line that groups content
</text>
<text start="27159.88" dur="2.872">
in lists and layouts. As you can see, here, we have a bunch of list
</text>
<text start="27162.752" dur="9.208">
components, and they&#39;re being divided into their own rightful sections with this divider,
</text>
<text start="27171.96" dur="3.5">
as you can see, here, we&#39;ve got that divider element.
</text>
<text start="27175.46" dur="4.87">
And it talks about the principles behind it. So it just is utilized to separate content
</text>
<text start="27180.33" dur="2.65">
into clear groups. And here you can see that it&#39;s heavily used
</text>
<text start="27182.98" dur="4.062">
in messaging. And this inbox, they&#39;re using lines to compartmentalize
</text>
<text start="27187.042" dur="5.628">
each message being sent and received. And here, you can use divider here you see
</text>
<text start="27192.67" dur="6.872">
dividers, splitting the description of this image and its pricing.
</text>
<text start="27199.542" dur="4.83">
And then also, it&#39;s splitting that content where it&#39;s very descriptive above and then
</text>
<text start="27204.372" dur="3.598">
where there&#39;s some actions below and splitting that content.
</text>
<text start="27207.97" dur="7.42">
And here we have a divider being utilized to split this page of what looks like contacts.
</text>
<text start="27215.39" dur="6.052">
And there&#39;s a lot of great in depth context here, I highly recommend you reading through,
</text>
<text start="27221.442" dur="4.868">
it&#39;ll allow you to make more intentional decisions on your designs moving forward.
</text>
<text start="27226.31" dur="5.07">
And we&#39;ll just improve your game as a designer. And here are some examples of dividers being
</text>
<text start="27231.38" dur="6.292">
used in certain material design themes such as the theme labeled fortnightly and owl material
</text>
<text start="27237.672" dur="2.95">theme. And here you can see what that would look</text>
<text start="27240.622" dur="6.198">
like a divider would look like on a on this primary background.
</text>
<text start="27246.82" dur="3.06">
And then also cheers just the specs, which is now in figma.
</text>
<text start="27249.88" dur="3.51">
We&#39;ll go ahead and create that. So very straightforward.
</text>
<text start="27253.39" dur="4.74">
It&#39;s one pixel and height. And we&#39;re just going to set that to the width
</text>
<text start="27258.13" dur="6.33">
of an Android device, which is 30 to 60 dip. So if I hit l on my keyboard, that creates
</text>
<text start="27264.46" dur="6.44">
the the divider the line, so I&#39;m going to set the width to 360 and the height to one
</text>
<text start="27270.9" dur="5.25">
pixel. So now I have Whoa, whoops, I&#39;m going to invert
</text>
<text start="27276.15" dur="2.122">that. So the width is 360.</text>
<text start="27278.272" dur="4.67">
And we now have this line. But the thing, the problem with this line
</text>
<text start="27282.942" dur="4.898">
is that we need to flatten this. So when I say flatten, we actually need to
</text>
<text start="27287.84" dur="3.96">
outline the stroke, because we have essentially a stroke as you can see here.
</text>
<text start="27291.8" dur="4.41">
And when we fly in this row, you&#39;ll notice in the Properties panel, it&#39;ll update, and
</text>
<text start="27296.21" dur="3.42">
we&#39;ll go to outline stroke, and it will now become Phil.
</text>
<text start="27299.63" dur="3.68">
And why do we want that wall, I&#39;ll have two examples for us, because it&#39;ll help us when
</text>
<text start="27303.31" dur="5.41">
it comes to measuring elements. Because right now this stroke is centered.
</text>
<text start="27308.72" dur="4.16">
So that blue line is the center of where things will be measured.
</text>
<text start="27312.88" dur="4.992">
And you&#39;ll notice that that&#39;s not actually giving us a proper measurement.
</text>
<text start="27317.872" dur="4.92">
So if we want to separate a group of text here, and we have this text box specified,
</text>
<text start="27322.792" dur="7.08">
you see how this is 60. Well, if I have this lined up, so they&#39;re
</text>
<text start="27329.872" dur="5.718">
both strokes, if I go ahead and now change this from stroke, you&#39;ll notice the distance
</text>
<text start="27335.59" dur="6.09">
is 60 dips. But watch, when I change this to a outline,
</text>
<text start="27341.68" dur="4.32">
stroke, I outline the stroke, it&#39;ll change it to a fill.
</text>
<text start="27346" dur="4.19">
And then you&#39;ll notice that now the distance is set to 59 pixels.
</text>
<text start="27350.19" dur="5.24">
So the point I&#39;m getting at is to be as precise as possible with these dividers, we need to
</text>
<text start="27355.43" dur="4.912">
ensure that we are flattening them. And flattening is just a term for you see
</text>
<text start="27360.342" dur="4.788">
how there&#39;s this line here. And then when I flatten it, it&#39;s it&#39;s actually
</text>
<text start="27365.13" dur="7.75">
a it&#39;s not a stroke anymore, so it&#39;s not in the center of that have the stroke.
</text>
<text start="27372.88" dur="5.29">
So it&#39;s now essentially kind of like a one pixel rectangle that&#39;s very thin, you can
</text>
<text start="27378.17" dur="6.122">
think of it as ended up with that being said, the measurements will be more precise.
</text>
<text start="27384.292" dur="6.408">
And that is exactly what we&#39;re trying to achieve. As opposed to this this stroke word set to
</text>
<text start="27390.7" dur="6.7">
60 in distance and this this flattened stroke which is no longer stroke is set to 59 so
</text>
<text start="27397.4" dur="4.27">that is actually more accurate. So that is great.</text>
<text start="27401.67" dur="2.58">
We have that there. And all we need to do is apply the proper
</text>
<text start="27404.25" dur="4.52">
color style and you need to ensure that your material design system library is enabled
</text>
<text start="27408.77" dur="7.8">
in this file, as always, and we&#39;ll go ahead and select our color styles and go to content
</text>
<text start="27416.57" dur="4.472">
and select the surface over Which is used for dividers here.
</text>
<text start="27421.042" dur="5.738">
And again, you can see that the color specified on that divider is set to 00, which is black
</text>
<text start="27426.78" dur="4.03">
and uses the 12% opacity. So it&#39;s very light, and subtle.
</text>
<text start="27430.81" dur="5.92">
And some important things to note is that other design systems specify several dividers,
</text>
<text start="27436.73" dur="3.57">
which essentially is just utilizing different color styles.
</text>
<text start="27440.3" dur="4.67">
And with those different color styles, it&#39;s just communicating.
</text>
<text start="27444.97" dur="2.48">
You could communicate different levels of opacities.
</text>
<text start="27447.45" dur="4.9">
For example, I detach this, say this was the regular divider set at 12%.
</text>
<text start="27452.35" dur="4.1">
But we had another divider that we wanted to be more prominent in color, we can actually
</text>
<text start="27456.45" dur="4.57">
bump up that opacity. Maybe I just bumped that up to 80% 87%.
</text>
<text start="27461.02" dur="6.482">
And if we wanted some sort of, for example, muted divider, whoops, let&#39;s see here, duplicate
</text>
<text start="27467.502" dur="6.248">
that we wanted a muted divider, we could just change that opacity, again, to represent different
</text>
<text start="27473.75" dur="7.002">
levels of prominence in the divider, and how you want that to how visible you want that
</text>
<text start="27480.752" dur="4.68">
to be on your designs. So that&#39;s, that&#39;s one way of going about building
</text>
<text start="27485.432" dur="1.408">things. But in material design, we just have this</text>
<text start="27486.84" dur="6.452">
one divider, and I&#39;m just gonna label that as regular that was just an example for you
</text>
<text start="27493.292" dur="7.3">
all, and just reapply that content surface overlay on surface color style, we now have
</text>
<text start="27500.592" dur="8.168">
our divider and I&#39;m gonna go ahead and label it dividers space slash space and then divider.
</text>
<text start="27508.76" dur="3.7">
So that is great. Actually, I can go ahead and just label this
</text>
<text start="27512.46" dur="5.69">
as divider and make that a master component main component, excuse me, and we are good
</text>
<text start="27518.15" dur="2.222">to go. And that is all we have to do to create a</text>
<text start="27520.372" dur="2.058">divider and thank you so much for watching.</text>
