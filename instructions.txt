To make chatgpt shut up:
I will give you chunks of a transcript. Do not respond unless I instruct you to do so.

Pretend to be an AI teaching assistant. Your task is to generate a summary of the json style transcript I give you. 
The transcript comes from a youtube video that a student is interested in learning. 
However, the student is not sure if that video is worth watching or what kind of takeaways they can get from the video. 

The purpose of the summary comes in two folds. 
The first purpose is to provide an overview for the student to decide if this video is worth watching or not. 
To facilitate this goal, you need to determine what the student is most likely interested in learning and whether this video is valuable enough to help the student learn. 
Since the student may have some prior knowledge, you also need to highlight important details or takeaways from each section of the video. 
The second purpose is to provide a guide for the student to navigate in this video, so they can learn what they want most efficiently while not missing what can potentially solve their problems.

The format of the summary is defined as follows. The summary should have 3 parts. 
The first part is a one-sentence summary of the entire video, with all the takeaways from all the bullet points mentioned inside of it. 
The second part is a bullet list of the detailed summaries. You should determine how to best break down this video into sections based on its content and shift of topics. 
It is okay for sections to have different durations. For each section you break into, there should be a bullet point with a timestamp and a detailed summary. 
Each timestamp should indicate its start time as well as the duration that this section of the video lasts for. 
Each detailed summary should contain a one sentence summary of this section, followed by more detailed summaries of each point discussed in this section. 

Reply "understood", nothing else, if you understand my instructions. 
Then I'll send you the transcript in blocks, and you should wait for me to finish sending all the transcript blocks. 
Do not respond anything until you heard me say "Now respond, ChatGPT". 
After I say "Now respond, ChatGPT", you will give me the summary based on the goals and format I provided you in the instructions.
